Hahaha, tot—hey, wait a second!
I hope this deal works out for you guys
Why do they have to adopt NCAA OT rules?
I'm a fan of Mario chalmers face, myself
I'd give half the credit to the Giants
The 20 triples is the real feat in there
The title still belongs to Giants Pats
Gio as a reliever is an interesting move
Shohei Otani is the new Travis Wood
They may have jumped the gun on this one
Japanese high school sounds interesting
The catwalks from the Trop are mandatory
I dont like college overtime either

Bold move leaving 4 empty bench spots
I feel like I've read this before
Hey y don't you fuck right off m8

Wait A third of his hits were home runs?
Hamels change up is pretty gnarly too
Replying to their own comment!?!?
Makes sense for Pittsburgh, not Toronto

That kind of fucks clock management
Joke's on you, I'm already dead inside
Best offensive catcher of all time?
I'd put Will Harris in over Ken Giles
Rumbunter isn't a legitimate source
Yup I take it to work everyday!
Estrada's changeup is a thing of beauty
There's actually hope for the Astros!
Let the Wade Boggs jokes rest in peace
Good point, forgot all about him
Cliff Lee was 8-3 with a 23 ERA too!!!!
not 9 though, that is right out
But this would be odd-year Chris Davis
Just signed for 2 years with the Royals
Well considering the stadium got razed

our outfield has two 2016 all-stars
Give it a couple of days then maybe?
Same with the Coliseum's poopy problems

I got my fill of that this year
This game beats the SEA vs NE Superbowl
; an MVP runner up,Stupid Braun
It's also the plot to the 90s Rams
Are you sure that's why they did it?
It will always be Jacobs field to me
These are old and tired:Yeah Jeets!
I want to be in Long Beach right now :(
I think he forgot about Pollock
Can't believe they signed him lol
And what if that quarter ends in tie?
I hate that I think you're right
TIL that's not what it stood for
But he isn't a lifelong Jay already
Oh, how I love you, Dayton Moore
Maybe the season has already started
Now this is a heartwarming meme
Del Pratt at 2BPhil Niekro at P
It's like you think we care hahaha
I would take a chance on that deal
Whinin' WaltersJohnson is a hypocrite!
I believe you are missing the point
Well, Boston does have fat stacks
Shitty yes but still funny as well
not as good as Enron Field, though
yeah, true harper had an off year

He also beat some 26 year old senseless
Use to call the spectrum the rectum
what about arena football ot rules?
Or if we get half of the Astros' farm
This would actually be really cool !
No worries, I'm just glad it made it!!
As an Astros fan I'm happy about this
What if it's still tied after 1 OT?
Remember when you gave us Addison Reed?
I never get tired of these updates!
I think the context makes it a bit funny
College ot rules are a sideshow
What you've never heard of golden goal?
How is that relevant to today's game?
Yeah right and the Cubs won in 2015

Casual flip of the bird there by Obama
Sounds like a rough season Real coarse
chad bentz wasn't such as good though
Oh my god those kids are so cute haha!
Damn, more recently than I had thought!
Where does your Mets fandom come from?
The Dolphins lost to the same team
Footballs a completely different animal
Already has a no-trade clause, even
I recognize this Gershwin reference
Isn't telus also owned by rogers?
They're probably referencing Sublime
I'd honestly put Martin over Perez
Aaron Judge would make a great bass
Aren't there 4 independent teams?
Sigh  Another season of this I see
I think he's for sure better than beef
My gawd the injuries are unreal
This makes me legitimately happy
Haha yeah, works for both I suppose
Did you even watch this man pitch?
Up there with Wade Boggs now fam
Yeah, Grandal is probably top 5
Nothing could supplant the Canseco AMA
Why do you keep saying 27 years?
Is there any way to watch it online?
That, and the I'm not your buddy, guy!
No, completely separate companies
Isn't Roark pretty similar to Hendricks?
and hopefully a position player pitching
Gonna get a comfy chair for this shit

Aka the worst type of overtime ever
Chris Johnson would like a word
Why are my stats not dropping?!!
I am curious to hear your ideal rotation
OH SHIT IT'S THE FUZZ, EVERYBODY RUN
No shit, that's my entire point
I wouldn't call Bautista's swing compact
CB Bucknor and or Joe West comes to mind
I always forget that one exists
Don't worry about it, he was pardoned
So uh, how about that Super Bowl!
I will never understand why we didn't
It's so easy to like Syndergaard
That is the current college format
Sure would suck for the catcher
dude had a pretty dirt nasty goatee
Nurse Ratchett, I want my cigarettes!

Whoops I mean to say we took the lead
It's not just 1 year, but whatever
Chipper, no :( Don't be one of those

He was injured and played 12 games?
Wait, what happened to Vin Scully?
And we don't know that he was driving
Yeah, but Ruth pitched 14 innings
why do you actually hate mclouth?
yeah god forbid people have empathy
He wasn't signed as a set up man
Weren't they both solo shots too?
Yes - gold tops are home alternates
Posey's never walked that much!
Does this somehow seem unrealistic?
It's time for the automatic strike zone
He jigawatted in some guy's mom though

Obviously, but why would you think that
Okay, that was really something Like wow
The Yankees bc that's just normal

That really was a spectacular catch
Nobody ever lies on the internet!
Well, being dicks is kinda wrong
Doesn't mean I have to respect them
Yeah, the pinstripes tripped me up
Yeah, those usually lead to runs scored
I'd also take Posey's swing motion
Dude got paid $50M for ONE CATCH
He's mad Jansen took his record
There's nothing like a surprise dong!

Because the FBI confirmed it, bro
Kirby Puckett, Game 6 1991 World Series
Instead it is the Tokey Mountain series

You don't do it  That's the explanation
He's a freaking basket case as well

Still weird seeing him on rosters now
Still more home runs than I have
Gonna give him some Padres love, too
I mean, do we count Hamilton or nah?
Oh cool, we're towards the bottom
Don't forget literally everything else
We have a Dredd themed flair for him
I mean you have UCONN and the Wolf Pack
Damn was he amazing Miss those years
He must've called him a cocksucker
you're a cocksucker YOU'RE A COCKSUCKER!
Sorry but what's your favorite team?
It felt like he wrecked us every time
Oh yeah Which I think makes sense
Yeah In had a blast when I did one
He was so nasty in RBI Baseball though
Does he have problems with control?
David Ross at catcher definitely
I wouldn't, and I love baseball
Where were you when I needed this?
Women can suck cock too, ya know
I want him to be 2015 Harper so much

I totally hit it on the round part
We got ourselves a natural disaster!
This is the kind of stuff I live for
Is that true for Spring Training?

Oh, so that's why Gibson beaned Honda
Jackie Bradley Jr or Kevin Kiermaier

By the slimmest of margins I'd go Correa
The kid can hit Get Bruce out of here
Didn't he play 162 games last year tho
Yeah Throwback jerseys are lame anyway
People aren't expecting them to do well?
Buster Posey or Jonathan Lucroy
Shit I bet coop could hit 3 home runs

Trout Marcus stroman or Chris archer
Achewood and pbf Please come back
Jose Ramirez because he is younger

Yelich Get more out of him that Yo
Gerardo Parra or Alexei Ramirez
Jose Bautista or Edwin Encarnacion

That's because Arenado plays in Coors
I would trust No-Finger Max over AJ Cole

So you're saying Babe Ruth is a liar?
I'm imagining this dubbed over Ether
PujolsGriffeyCabreraMannyIchiro
Pujols GriffeyCabreraIchiroManny
Pujols, Cabrera, Manny, Griffey, Ichiro
Not really because they still won
Albert Pujols or Mark Reynolds?
Throw an NSFW tag on that, mmm mmm!
You just gotta lead with your cup
Melvin Upton Jr or Justin Upton?
Something something Gary Sanchez
He was never seen as really caring
Only 6 against the Phils as well
This is easily the answer for me
Ben Bishop getting traded to the kings
I've been saying that for years
Yeah but we haven't had him for years
Goldschmidt, best 1B in baseball IMO
Totally are These are some of the best
Sale to the Red Sox Came outta nowhere
Brandon Phillips or Alexei Ramirez
I thought his first at bat was a HR?
Correa reminds me so much of young ARod
This makes menervous for the future lol
Ah thanks Never watched Seinfeld
I still don't fully understand this
\; 30 years later; COME ON PUT TEBOW IN!
Can anyone really explain this?
when you skip everything but leg day
; the last timeThat's what you think!
1967-68 Bob Gibson or 99-00 Pedro?
Then how do you explain Bartolo Colon?
Matthews to the Blackhawks confirmed
Bartolo Colon: The Human Outlier
TIL that Ichiro is a Tyrannosaurs Rex
Exactly, and he didn't get old at 35
The Angels fielded a real team, _okay!
I always upvote Ichiro and legs
Welp, you jinxed it, sorry Cubs fans
Dansby and Ender for Shelby Miller
This makes the most sense Thank you
My favorite player atm Love you Ichi!
I like where this scenario is going
Too bad they gave up two safeties
A bunch of scrubs from d3 schools
Or getting fat then losing weight
Neither do the laws of child support
As overall players or just as hitters?
That use to be our Ichiro(43) :(
They just need to throw a cutter
;Jesus Christ can't hit the curveU wot?
Is this for his first start or 2nd?
I think his eligibility is done
No, this is just the first inning
I understood some of those words!
Probably dying on the field I'd assume
Every day is leg day for Ichiro
You mean Bishop won't score goals?!?
Quality of their innings plays big too
There really isn't a debate here
That's how you consistently get on base
Sanchez or Archer is a better compare
Why not change the rule instead?
this man will play until he is 60
One of my favorite players ever
How is he a Brewer before a Twin?
Not like the Rangers are much better
i googled artour's TI wins BrokeBack
Bryant, and it isn't even close

It's still stupid that he's not in
We won 3 of 4 it wasn't a sweep
Canada has one minor league team?
For Trade: One Ellsbury, please take him
I feel like this is the correct answer
The travel would be absolutely brutal
So how'd you become a Twins fan?
Pretty good really recent answer
I thought it was dumb for that as well
What, 26 rings and a pocketwatch?
Arizona, but who really needs the Reds?
Better just ban her from trying then
That was a heck of a beautiful swing
The Nationals didn't get a closer
GodI love old baseball :( ahahaha
Chris Carter signing for pocket change
Does hurt mean warm and tingly?
He was also intentionally walked 120(!)
They can exceed by sweeping the playoffs
They're getting chippy now that they won
You met Crazy Joe Davola right?

Why Travis why go to an AL team
Huh, maybe that's the case, idk

The Hawk, the Kid, and the Rock
Imagine if Ichiro never went to the KHL
Those hanging sliders broke him
Very excited to attend the SD games!
Why does he have an Indians flair
I bet she gets lots of really big tips
Seems kind of lowOh, I mean nice
Blood spinning and human growth hormones
Very fair I can agree with that
So he or his girlfriend could play it
So he'll be banging 18 year old models?
Do people forget Bartolo took PEDS!!?
Aaaand now I want that awesome shirt
you're not a stats guy, are you?
Because Mike Trout knows what's up!

North american baseball crowds suck

JOSE QUINTANA IS THROWING A NO-HITTER
We need to fucking rock Quintana
Why doesn't givens throw more sliders?
It was to let him pitch against Canada
Fucking Quintana Creep can roll, man
U gotta let him go to 65 pitches right?
UNTIL THERE ARE NO MORE INNINGS
Dammit Quintana Stop being so good
The fuck is Stanton swinging at there?
Well this is kinda embarrassing
Well Stanton looked like dogshit there
If we were playing isis than maybe
That was an ugly at bat, Stanton
Yeah we should trade for Arenado
What if your sister has testicles?
23 casualties lmao now that's efficiency
Let's go USA, it's only the 6th inning!
God damn this US team looks deflated
Gregerson gonna strike out errbody
How many pitches is Quintana at?
You pretty much summed it all up

I don't think Never comes before Never
What about the Quidditch World Cup?
Venezuela looks really good too
Murphy will get a hit broedit: fml
I'd put a years salary on that (39k)
that's so accurate it's debilitating
England actually won a world cup though
That fucker is so goddamn good I hate it
Easy there bud, let's not get hasty haha
Best Dominican hitter of all time
Even the powerhouse that is Colombia?
Forgot Jarrod Dyson and Brett Gardner

Right down the fucking middle, Cutch

Quintana had HendricksFace there
RALLY TIMESOMEONE GET THE RALLY MONKEY

I think we would beat them with pitching
Kinsler infield pop-up incoming
FUCK YA THAT'S MY SECOND BASEMEN

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, KINSLER
That's some classic Rangers Kinsler
Come on Nado, let's get that lead
Maybe nolan brought Coors to this AB
There's blood in the water, boys
Ump being stingy on the inside edge
More like low-level non-prospect amirite

Americans don't have heart for the WBC?
He's not great Marlins fan here
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU CALL ME BIG HOSMAH
oh god eric ground ball hosmer now
Nolan Charlie Fucking Hustle Arenado
I would literally never take Goldy out
Hosmer can really swing the bat
Fuck he is one of my favorite players
Taking out Goldy for Hosmer wtf
Should've just let Goldschmidt hit
He better save that for the season
Leyland too old school for this game
Better than Texeira Objectively
some say hes still warming up out there
The USA World Baseball Classic team
The us games won't sell out in miami
Why would he invite any of them?
I want to see Dyson vs Bautista tomorrow
He's been playing too much golf recently
A pitch down the middle of the pipe
He's playing catch with Craig Kimbrel
Sam Dyson pitches for the Rangers
Dyson has a really stoic pitch face
More like UNCLE SAM Dyson to you, guy
That movement is nuts I will say that
Holy shit these pitches are filthy
I can't believe you've done this
Your bullpen is already really good
Good thing Dyson doesn't suck tonight
Screw the mandatory 1 day rest rule
I need to send Miami a thank you card
He's flinging the sphere pretty well
It's going great for you so far
Would you like Qualls and Motte?
Then what the hell happened in 2015?
Molina shouldn't be batting 5th
RIGHT IN THE ASS YOU BETTER WATCH IT
Polo's positioning was perfect in CF
Doesn't he get hit somewhat often?
Pinch hit Yelich and let him jack one
Hello, 2013 Murphy Long time no see
Colombia's playing a good game here
now that is a rare phrase for our flair
Someone gave Bautista nanomachines?
Nippon Express is my favorite Anime
love MLB TV for not seeing this
0-3 is a really hard count to get to
Good point I forgot he was on the roster
Damn Murphy is having a brutal game
BOW DOWN TO YOUR CRAWFORD OVERLORD
That delivery makes me uncomfortable
That backhand was baseball porn
I'm already sick of this guys wind up
What kind of throwing motion is this?
Your lineup is filthy Buena suerte primo
Matty V with the strong pun game
Go onI wanted him this offseason
Jones helped bail him out though
Jones is getting boned by the ump
That looked like a strike to me
Cabrera has a team option for 2018 too
SHE'S GOT EYES OF THE BLUEST SKIES
Wild Thing you make me nauseous
Hey now, time to stop this madness
So kinda like Troy Tulowitzki's?
Who else would you rather have?
I'm gonna call a hit up the middle
Yea, he's coming in after Zach Britton
I love player-glove romances ❤
Tough bunch of people Fyi, it's colombia
Big gamerloves to play clash Royale wtf
Why is the bullpen a green screen
Think you're looking for the word weeb
god damn Nolan I love you so much
NOLAN FUCKING ARENADO FOR PRESIDENT!!!
AAAANNNNDDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
His constant readjusting may be forgiven
NO TIME FOR HYPE ALREADY INTO IT
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT MLB NETWORK

What's a sticker!--cut to leadoff double

Read his article from yesterday
Same here He's just such a joy to watch
WHY DID YELICH NOT START THIS GAME
Yelich ; Pulisicsource: more WAR
I will murder everyone that you love
Ball got to the fucking Bermuda Triangle
Ellsbury will be the only survivor
He's one of my favorite players now!
MILLER IN THE BULLPEN, LETS DO THIS BOYS
Enjoy that about 30 times a season
Same could be said about Chris archer
I grew to hate all of those commentators
arenado is clutch, he'll come through
this guy in centerfieldgod dammit
Stanton will save us with a walk off
Tito Polo with another amazing catch!
Tito Marco Polo Marco Polo Marco Polo!
great hit just went right at him
Polo is totally man of the match
Try r MLBstreams if you need to man!
Can we get some stats on if he's clutch?
Easily my favorite position player
That's his only flaw don't worry bb ❤
Tito has been all over the place tonight
HE'S ONE OF YOUR FUCKIN' FARMHANDS
Do they have a 6-piece cod meal?
They're playing Puerto Rico though
Oh I thought it'd be 1-10 by now, lol
Ah dicksyelich is in at outfield
Here's what I think of your shift
Can we get some stats on if he's Cutch?
Jesus, my heart No more big hits pls
I don't think McCutchen makes that catch
Wew, I thought that was out of here
Yelich ate that ball up like it was ass
Archer's a really good interview
The official website says otherwise
They ain't too far from overtown too lol
Neshek almost lost his face lol
That Marco Polo pun, we had it coming
bring in andrew miller you cocksucker
Marlins fan here I'll keep it going
Why does the USA plays so tense?
Where's Tito when you need him?
That probably should have been caught
T O R T U R EORT O R T U R EURE
you think these teams want to win?
I need a gif of Neshek's celebration
LET'S WALK THESE MOTHERFUCKERS OFF
agreed, vasgersian seemed bewildered
What song was that during the face out?
let's go USA make america great again!!!
This doesn't bode well for facing the DR
Well that was a minor heart attack
fuck yeah Neshek love that emotion wooo
LETS PUT IT ON THE BOARD, YEESSSS!
If we lose to a bunt, sac fly combo
Not if it's good Chinese takeout
Depends, how good is this place?
You're eating the wrong chinese food
So when does Steve Cishek come in
DONT TALK SHIT ABKUT HYVEE CHINESE
That's a 10 year contract swing boys!
Not right now youll miss thr 9th
FIGHT ME IRL MEET ME IN TEMECULA
How many Solanos are on Colombia lol
It's okay, man We're all friends for now
Wait why is it empty, its america
no offense, but Hosmer kinda sucks ass
IF HOSMER STARTS TOMORROW VS DR WE RIOT
'Shit the announcers say' thread?
My pants are feeling tight as-is
So they're all doing bath salts?
Posey has caught Moscoso before!!!
Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
YOIRE SUPPOSED TO HOLD ON TO THE BAT
The Royals are ruining baseball
Did the pink shirt dude get it?
That was a wrestling match for that bat
put a tether on that thing, Gerald
Tcoulda told you that before the game
I'm betting Lucroy starts tomorrow
Stanton is primed to have a big year
That was a lot of build-up for a popout
Why does God forsake the Marlins?
That passed ball is fucking massive
Stanton hits one a mile high, for an out
Free baseball during a baseball drought!
The best kind too It's been a good game
Starting in the 12th inning I think
Opposed to the normal episodes?
OhYou should have planned ahead
Crawford made that play look SIMPLE
Mmmm Crawdaddy carrying this defense
Uhhh Nado has done his fair share
Clippard's specs are lit af 'Murica
These extra inning rules are lame AF
Can you even swing the bat harder?
Part of me wants this to go to the 11th
Can't do that Not there Next please!
Goddammit Tyler Clipboard gave up a walk
head, shoulders, knees and toes
Do we really need it in 100pt font?
yeah but how is he on horseback
Statcast knows  They always know
Basically all of Nolans base running
atta boy clip, way to battle back
Cano is a good 2nd baseman and hitter
I think that was Israel beating Korea
Needs to get his hitting together though
HEY MURPH, PRETEND IT'S THE 2015 NLCS
I will marry you if that happens
How much for one of them ribs tho?
OR LITERALLY ANY GAME LAST YEAR
USA needs to pull an Israel here
These fucking Colombian outfielders
These Colombian outfielders like to dive
insert fourth out shenanigans here
Be a man Do what your wife wants
Did we get a catch probability on that?
aaahhhhh fuck it, just do a coin flip
Isn't that the point of the thread??
Just place in Stanton Easy peasy win
Democracy on first Liberty at bat
Can't wait for an Egalitarian Slam
So who's Dany and who's Jon Snow?
I got some D action going on tonight too
Please, Crawford Take me to Jalisco
Didn't know anybody else read that book
That pitch gave me a heart attack
Hello tense baseball I remember you
Game saving catch by polo incoming
I'd love to see a balk-off here
Cant be Santiago Casilla isnt pitching

This level of play will not get them far
They'll be out of pitchers by then
I'm gonna go light a candle for Quintana
Did he really just say Murica ?
FUCK MANFRED'S STUPID EXTRA INNING RULE
What a fantastic game, props to Colombia
Orioles Givens and Orioles taketh away
lol archer drenched the reporter as well
Adam Jones first career gatorade bath
-Everyone but Manfred, definitely
aDAMN Jones and Yelich are STELLAR

all these qt US grils in the stands ;;;
It was almost  r nba level speed
We'll be fine if we just let Goldy play
I predict a mercy rule in the 5th
completely agree He was nearly perfect
Looking forward to tomorrow's game
Jamie Foxx coming through in the clutch!
Adam Jones pulled a David Wright!
Oh sure, now a Met gets Escobar out
Let the play speak for itselfmostly
BASEBALL IS BACK BOYS AND GIRLS!
It's been back for a couple of days
That defense was really excellent
God bless the United States of America
What inning does it come into play?
Yeah, but it's a Fuckin sweet car
BET YOU'RE OKAY WITH HIM BATTING 2ND NOW
I like you Let me get you some plantains
Well he has those two no-hitters
I don't blame Bryce for not playing
It will only be Borikén to me!
These lineups are actually terrifying
I upvoted your post before I removed it!
SCORE ONE FOR FREEDOM MOTHERFUCKERS
I did not know that distinction!
Felix can basically do whatever he wants
Felix misses Seager being there at third
Shhhh don't let them know about us
oh my god carlos stop it with your hair
oh god, did Beltran bleach his hair?
How do you think he got on base?
This is good, this is very good!
Terrorist your game is through!
Wait FC Barcelona has a baseball team?
What should the cops have done?
Oh that explains my question above
WHY IS EVERYONE DYING THEIR HAIR?
Sold out for the DR matchup tomorrow
Uhh, maybe don't throw the hanging curve
Come on VENEZUELA Make it rain webon
Why couldn't they not go after Harper?
Ah you know the good stuff, I got you
That's why Yankees were first out
7 consecutive ground balls, c'mon guys
CAUSE NOW YOU HAVE TO ANSWER TO
Am I watchibg June Mets baseball?
Parallel to 9gag would be iFunny
Gary is the best meme on  r wsgy
SOMEBODY GET THAT MAN A PIE IN THE FACE
Could work in your favor long term
Need to be more patient at the plate
Pagan is a fan of teams with orange
Why warm him up in the first place?
Come on Soto settle the fuck down
You might wanna walk that one back a bit
Who are you guys rooting for and why
PR, It's American and they have Yadi
this carpet in field is such shit
ONCE AGAIN WE MEET AT LAST ROB MANFRED
I needed a good clench today anyways
Rob Manfred hates puppies and apple pie
Lol, he just called Yadier Bengie
Did they also just call Yadier Jose?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
That was a nasty pitch to get CarGo!
Venezuela because Ender is cool
He's still got some life left, I think
Comeback player of the year this year!
lol why the golden hair though?
Why do we bottle it every single WBC
What are next week's lottery numbers?
So did Beltran bleach his facial hair?
OKAY, FINE, I'LL ROOT FOR YOU, MOLINA
Correa and Yadi hitting some bombs
Holy hell chacin just got rocked
And I immediately said, Fuck yeah!
Some Mets in September did it too
Yeah ever since I was a young boy!
You believe everything you are told
That sexy defense makes me moist
That's a 5 tool name if I ever saw one
This is such a beautiful infield :')
Can't tell if you're being serious
This makes me feel tingly things
Good battle between Joe and Alcides
So lick my butt and suck on my balls
he is literally Tony Gwynn against us
Did everyone in PR bleach their hair?
Yankees are so fucking lame lmfao
Esky really should've gloved that one
If he's a virgin, I'm a cheese scone
It looks silly, but that's not the point
Una carrera mas y no jodemos mas!
WOULD SOMEBODY STOP THE DAMN GAME?!?!?
YikesThat really sucks if that happened
It's like a walk-off by fatality!!!
Nope Nope nope nope Nooooope Paws off
Gotta get those Guadalajara bitches
Fucked em harder than the economy!
I could say the same about your team
Americito has MERCIED COMMUNISM
That was some leg kick from Yadi
I hope so We've been playing like shit
He's not your regular Pirate though!
Well, PR is part of the US to be fair
This whole thing is totally Florida
That's a funny way of spelling T-e-b-o-w
I thought that was the LBJ school!
Midwest Just haven't run into it I guess
Not sure it was worth the loss though
Thank god cueto into pitching this round
I fault him a little but I still get it
Blue Jays fans are indeed bad people
Hi, from all Why is this funny?
who wants who to throw actual pitches?
Is it really that crazy a thing?
Where the cringe is in the comments
North Denver Metro Area Citizen
Japan PR game in SF was Hella fun
I really have only 192 comments?
Serious question Is he any good?
I feel the same about Brandon Crawford
that this was an onion headline
We are disliked even in Israel?
Op's mom got in the liquor cabinet again
Aha, pretty funny Thanks for the info
Agreed Paul can go fuck himself
Someone isn't trusting the process
An 0-2 pitch right down the middle?
Like Bumgarner trying to bop Bautista
It's something they teach at Jays camp
Here we go again with this bullshit
Thanks for those interesting examples!
Start berating them in Chinese!
NOW That's What I Call The 90's!
I bet that's the only reason he signed
I should go play baseball in Japan
How about former Jets Quarterbacks?
So she's like a real life Misery lady
This makes me like the O's even more
yeah but then they ran into SETH LUGO
That was goodreal good Well played
Did you watch the game last night?
Well, you won't know till you've tried
I'm walking on sunshine, woahhh ohhh
Fourteen hours of baseball today
Like Harper hoping to harm Hosmer
should I just pull my dick out now?
That doesn't mean Bryant isn't better
How did he cost himself a ring?
Kyle Long (NFL Bears) does as well
;_; who am I supposed to root for
I can't stop laughing at the pretzel guy
Tag yourself I'm Faaaack Yooou Guy
;Julio Teheran	| Gwinnett Braves(AAA)	??
That's completely fine, thanks!
Here's hoping we see Game Over tonight
Because you're unoriginal and a tool
What have they done to deserve this?
Damn I like him he's a good guy
\ cough 2016 All Star Game cough \
The loser here is eliminated right
not necessarily, but most likely
Maybe he was a Hawaii 5-0 pr guy
May I proposition the New York Mets?
So he's going to play in Norfolk?
Tim Leiper is a national treasure
Tavarez is going back to Boston?
shoulda gone in head first on that one
Or plantains dipped in maple syrup
What were Santana's season numbers?
That's some great defence by Teheran
it was valverde coulda been an accident
How do they decide who get's eliminated?
So like any other Marlins game then
He got traded lol How is that his fault?
Jamie Romak showing off his range
In all seriousness, go away Tim Tebow
that makes a lot more sense no flame
I'm sorry we won two All Star games u_u
How can it be rarer than it is now?
Mom is from Winnipeg, can confirm
Don't be disrespectful to Tebow
I'm sure Wright is fine with it
K that's pretty epic I wanna believe
What a changeup That shit just dropped
It's been pretty questionable lol
Is there no post game or recap thread?
I guess you're good at stealing then?
Cant be any worse than Hanley Ramirez
Terrible decision to go to second there
Is it me or does Gagne look NERVOUS
I thought he was gonna puke just there
Bringing that old man heat at 94
94mph?Why hasn't he pitched in 9 years?
Gagne can still throw 94?That's insane
Gagne kinda looks like Seth Rogen
He's thrown 1 strike in 9 pitches
The velocity is there The command is not
93 and 94 from Gange95 holy shit
Well, that could have gone worse
A 3-1 lead should suffice for Colombia
When has a 3-1 lead ever been safe?
Please don't do that again Arenado
It was for Detroit last night :(
Was sort of hoping hockey would be next
I don't have enough alcohol atm
Surprised he hit 93 on a fastball wow
My anger at umpires is in midseason form
Just waiting for a Gagne changeup
The mariners offense against josh tomlin
Yeah We'll see how he does in AA AAA
Give that man a minor league deal!
I want to see Larry Walker get some cuts
IIRC the strike killed the 1994 Angels
Bring in Roy Holliday in Toronto's honor
It's a good day to be Eric Gagne
I think the Nats have found their closer
Nah someone's gonna give him more money
He's better all-around than Bryant ;)
That's not how it's spelled in the US
If that runner gets to 3rd, its over
no reason not to try another bunt
The commentary was on point tho
Bonds is almost as thin as Dee Gordon
Haha he was mid 30s but clearly joking
it's really not that unbelievable
So many Colombians in attendance
What a sight that would be, though
Yeah, but what's wrong with Freddie tho?
Corey Seager would like a word please
literally most good Canadian players
Morneau is just a shadow of himself
Did it look like he fell on purpose?
Eric Wood is the center for the Bills
How popular is baseball in colombia?
You can't take 2 strikes out in the 9th
The WBC games are blacked out in Canada
Just don't Fuck this up too, pls
The people have spoken  u gustamos
No one knew what WAR was in 1996
You have some barry homerun balls?
Your supposed to love the dh now
Someone's sleeping in the couch tonight
WE SUCK, MADURO DIET TOO STRONG
Home plate umpire must be blind
I figured I'd continue the trend
Home run derby to decide the winner
what kind of baserunning was that lol
Pujols' contract is DRAINING this team
Same as he was in his 20s, then?
Where's my baseball pachinko machine at?
Not a good game for baserunning
Wouldn't it make it impossible to game?
He should get some of what Eric's on
It's a direct quote from a movie
Absurd amount of foul territory
I mean, basketball is already Canadian
That's just because god hates the sixers
Martin Perez is not good Analysis
Nah he's part of the furious five
Did he really slim down from last year?
Are you watching the Spanish feed?
Nimmo hit a homer and we missed it??
Soooo did Trump just nuke Mexico?
Teheran is the real deal go braves!
Mmmmm yes that tracking ability
Fuck I thought it was a homerun
Herrera hitting a fly ball KBO NPB style
A healthy Reyes would sure be nice
Da Silva is always nasty in LVBP
Is it too soon for a Ken Caminiti joke?
Thumbnail kinda gives it away though
Kelly Gruber signed ball with I got him
I don't remember 2k9 having one
that's true, kid we gotta be careful
Tyler Austin too when he gets back
Oh look it's human trash Hector Olivera
Ah, the Smith Trumbo platoon What fun
We call him slowarte for a reason
Are we sure that wasn't Dennis Quaid?
We did; worst trade in franchise history
ITT: casual sexism covered up by facts
;Italian accordion at the ballpark
VR ump mode would be the dopest shit
And the Godfather theme nonetheless!
The OCD is strong in this one &lt;3
FROM TRIANGLE TO SQUARE IN ONE COMMENT
Me tooTo: Jretribe, Peace, Ernie Banks
Do you know why the change was made?
Hell of an at bat by Altuve so far
He would've caught that on real dirt
Wasn't he on Marlins Park last night?
woah, he's out bad angle from the ump
He's out 3rd baseman foot was in the way
Yup Bad things happen from one error
was that Freddy Garcia on the bench?
Talk about conflicting emotions oh boy
Is cervelli going to change jerseys now
One of the worst umpired games so far
Night Trayne to the house of Payne!
What does the hat shaking mean?
As I said, if it was a joke, high five
Now they're playing like an actual team!
wow that was some beautiful hitting
Does XBone have no baseball game?
Cervelli helping his fellow Venezuelans
I'll never use it It's on display
Yeah that boy was never very bright
You have a point, but you're also an ass
Had I not played for 16 years, probably
I got a signed brooks Robinson card
Is 9 batters considered batting around?
lol tbf they had to deal with a rod
Let's not think about that mkay
How do we know OP was being lazy?
He's some kind of baseball savant
Italy making this thing a ballgame!
When hit-and-run goes horribly wrong
I'm here to bask in American freedom
NY-GUY - wicked I'm onto you OP
Any lineup would be ideal without hosmer
Watching pitcher's hit gives me AIDS
That was the longest fucking inning
I mean, Ethiopia got a pretty bad one
I'm watching MLBTV, what'd I miss?
how do we watch this on mlbcom?
Yelich batting third Hell yes, Leyland
There's no way he's 235 260 probably
The ol' quadfork I like your style
They're gonna switch to the USA DR game
Glad leyland noticed that yelI can rake
Jalisco ump couldn't wrap it up, B
Machado making 34 errors confirmed
Hooooooooooly shit those unis are sexy
Why is Hosmer hitting for Murphy lmao
He got up to 94mph in that game as well
Pray for a Quintana-esque no decision!
She means pay up or pound sand, fucko
We usually sell out for opening days
Lol what the hell was Prado doing?
Pls kick ass, Luc  I miss you :(
Amphibious pitcher strikes again!
He's gonna hit em with that confusion!
God I wish this was an Olympic sport
idk why we have Hosmer playing at all
It will be in the next Olympics
Technical Difficulties: 1 shot of vodka
These horns are going to get annoying
How do they pick umps for the wbc?
3 pitches in, rally horn comes out
Throw Jones a hanging changeup!
Lmao they got so hype for that ball
this game this crowd is amazing hahaha
Never watched a futbol game eh lol
Yelich is gonna be a monster this year
Dammit my stream is 40 seconds behind :(
Where are these fans for Marlins games?
Why is Hosmer starting over Murphy?
Waiting for Loria to roll into his grave
Those bro dudes were pretty loud
Goldy can't get no respect on this team
Murphy's way better than Kinsler
Vuvuzelas they're the Devils doing
Girl in the short jeans is fiiiiiine

Has this stadium ever been this packed?
screw the marlins man He hates us
Love how electric the stadium is
Bautista v StromanBooster Juice v HDMH
What kind of strike zone is that
lol Hosmer starting over Goldschmidt
Too much baseball to watch in March!?
I am so incredibly jealous of that man
Pre-game odds: DR -125 +104 USA
That's why Leyland put in Hosmer
Fuck you r baseball-Eric Hosmer
Because he's worse than Goldschmidt?
Fuck you Eric Hosmer-r baseball
I really don't like the USA jerseys
Command was spotty But no damage
Intense blue jay vs blue jay action
haha Hosmer with a leadoff hit!
Hosmer's here to shit on you all
Man what can't that Eric Hosmer do?
Goldy woulda hit a double-r baseball
Something something Hosmer sucks

As a tall and fat guy, just say fat
Sorry your team had to join the heathens
Fuck you Reddit nerd-Eric Hosmer
On ESPN Deportes VEN v ITA is still on
Bunch salty butts in here Salvy dong btw
Now that corner is a strikecome on blue
What MLBers are playing for Italy?
Hosmer would have gotten a single
That should've only been strike 2
Cmon I need a Stanton massive donger
Finally something I relate with
Why are there so many DRians in america?
Cause America is a good place to live
Miami is about as close as you can get
large amount of refugees in the 1980's
When was the last time Stanton was hot?
Where the fuck did that shit miss?
Friends don't let friends do the wave
Nice Pulisic jersey someone is wearing
You don't recognize a former MVP?
THE EVIL WBC CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM!

K-Rod blowing saves and blowing knees
A lack of speed killed Salvador Perez :(
Oh shit  Really hope Perez is ok
That's just some sloppy baseball
Adam Jones you magnificent bastard
I dont get how one company can hold it?
Starling Marte really looks like 50 Cent

ADAM BUBBLE BLOWING MOTHER FUCKING JONES
Odd year bullshit starting early boys

Venezuela Scores and leads 11-10
Yelich early breakout for NL MVP
Holy fuck he turned on the jets
Christian Literally Goldschmidt Yelich
And that's why he got the error
TUVE SCORES VENEZUELA ON TOP AGAIN
‪What a game for Martin Prado!
Venezuela takes a 11-10 lead in the 10th
That would've been a homerun in Coors
Fun fact: Yelich likes hitting doubles
Me too, I'm just not very good at it
If Marte called it, that's on Cruz
Of course Altuve lost his helmet lol
Thank you 11% not caught probability
OH SHIT A POPUP VIDEO REFERENCE
And we're making The Giants pay for it
looked like the jersey moved  Dammit
if the WBC had replay, that's an out
Who hired these umps, they are atrocious
Is there no challenges in the WBC?
These umps are some damn communists  s
Any live streams for poor people?
Cs and CHs are backwards in Italian lol
IT TAKES TWO TO MAKE A THING GO RIGHT

A telegram group would also be cool
Is the horn really that annoying?
Shhhhhh don't ruin his freerection
WE CALL THEM AMERICA FREEDOM HELPERS
The game took 14 days and 9 months lol
Who do the DR have in their pen?
Oh man I hope this isn't serious
Swype keyboard  Leaving it, lol
Wait that was the third baseman?
So theyve all gone through menopause?
Cano hustling in mid-season form
But what about the bullpen catcher?
Tanner Roark, then probably Miller
Stanton will hit one 500ft off Dumbo
Holy SHIT that pimp walk GIF please?
How do I watch the VOD of the full game?
MarKKKKus Stroman is an American Hero
Stroman you're like a swaggy bald eagle
I like winning, winning's my favorite
Bruce Springsteen is so overrated tbh
Idk are you watching Stroman today?
Lots of hard throwing white dudes
Per an interview last week, he's 5'6
5'8 of swingin steel and sex appeal
He got hit so hard it buried him
Yelich right into the commie shift
fuck those peach basket on a pole fucks
Christian Yelich ;; Ted Williams
Well, I guess I'll allow Neris this one
is this the 2010 world cup or what
Ted Williams, who's that guy  s
This is INTERNATIONAL BASEBALL &lt;3
I'd honestly be willing to pay for that
Explain to me what the subreddit is
Nothing is more annoying than a vuvuzela
Holy fuck Marcus Stroman is amazing
Stro almost moonwalking up in here
Stroman at maximum strut right now

More like Tanner No-ark amirite?
Really that's pretty awesome actually
Hopefully they teach you grammar
Don't make the base paths carpet
I mean DR's line up is freaking intense
And Ted Nugent playing in the background
Shouldn't Australia be better at rugby?
Jumbo Diaz ate all the plantains
JUMBO Diaz is rightfatass pitcher
Nothing official which is pretty insane
They also suck, so there's that too
These announcers are fat shaming!
Wooo look at the legs on Jumbo!
Hahahahaha nobody watches Marlins' games
You mean where power hitters go to die?
TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT SHUT UP ALREADY
Matt Vasgersian and John Smoltz
I'd rather do nothing and make millions
Doesn't want to block peoples views
Most patient player in the league!
STANTON THE AMERICAN HERO COMES THROUGH
I never knew Goldy was so quick
Stanton's swing makes me hard every time
The DR might have made a Jumbo mistake
Lol Stanton smiling after that hit
Woooow that's awesome Who'd have thought
not even the game after Fernandez died?
There's no way he doesn't get 70 bags
Hey at least you're not the Netherlands
That's how you know God is right
that was a pretty dirty slider honestly
Now the pressure is on the catering crew
Hooray for the USA's starting pitchers!
Time to leave that communist bar
Except being fucking good at catching?
Not before I sprint for the nearest door
THESE COLORS DON'T RUN, AND GET RUNS
Posey AND Crawford in the same draft?
Hispaniola Island, right next to Haiti
ESTADOS ESTÁN UNIDOS AS FUCK RIGHT NOW
Damn that would be disappointing
Probably all in the Clevelander
The airhorn may be done Hopefully
Hey, I'm just quoting the announcer
I think that was the point, bud
Diamondbacks were ahead of the curve
I did and they did USA Sorry Beltre
Pence is definitely a unicycle guy
If you have to ask you can't afford it
Holy fucking shit that ball was crushed
Machado going into Stanton land
r monsterdongs gets a new monster dong
Machado hit the shit out of that one
YOU TOOK OUR FREEDOM WE TOOK YOUR GRINGO
Machado throwing this team on his back
Booo Cano That kinda hurts to say
It should also have a PSVR mode
Let's get someone up in the pen
Fucking Roark  That name is suspect
Plz baseball gods no Bautista bomb

Just tuned in, damn, what a crowd
So uh, still mad about the playoffs?
GET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF THERE LEYLAND
Bautista is looking to top Machado here
They don't hear my prayers anymore
Pools are the best place to have 3 ways

Leave it to the Gnats to fuck it all up
You know who the US needs right now?

Why is Benedict Roark still out there
Nationals bullpen is in mid season form
We're loud  It's just who we are
Mods, please ban Roark from America
What was the catch probability on that?
This outfield always feels gigantic
How would you figuratively take him out?
You hating over there looks real awful
I mean geographically it's close
Let's see how spry you are at 136
Holy shit @ that accurate throw
What a fucking cannon Attaboy Stanton
Never visit the Caribbean, my friend
I love you no matter what you do, Beltre
Christ Almighty This is stressful
You're going down a path I can't follow!
A guy brought his fricking saxophone!
Jesus look how hard Roark is breathing
People brought saxophones to the game?!
THE GODDAMN UNCLECHING JUST HAPPENED
Tanner Roark bends but doesn't break?
I'm glad I got off Mr Roark's Wild Ride
This is a slogan I can get behind
His pouting tool is a solid 75+
We're that hyped at the bar I'm at
Wait, anyone can watch on MLBtv?

Santana concert busting out in RF
Nice at-bat by Adam here in any case

Thisssss isssss bullllssshiiittttt
HOLY FUCK THIS WBC HAS BEEN AMAZING
Ump just ejected an entire country
holy shit that was a great play
Holy shit, half the team gets tossed
TELL ME AGAIN NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE WBC
UMP is getting the colombian neck tie
THEY TOLD ME BAUTISTA'S ARM WAS DEAD
Which players got ejected there?
Dear baseball, Im so glad youre back
This is amazing VAMO COÑASOOOOOOOO
Yeah, is that not in place for the WBC?
Did the ump toss like 5 guys there?
fuck yea wellington CAstillo!!!!
The play brought him there though
Anyone know who actually got tossed?
I think it was everyone in a row
Isn't that just an alternative fact?
That throw was accurateIt was not strong
They bumped the umpire like that?
colombian players getting tossed, damn
What was controversial about that?
Yeah I doubt solano even realized
Beat Canada and rematch vs DR I think
His glove was clearly touching his leg
but until he did he was a bit parked
I don't think anyone knows for sure
With DR and Colombia make it 8!
got a source for that insanity?
Baseball is boring they say LOL
Tito Polo and Reynaldo Rodriguez
Jose isn't know for a strong arm?
José Bautista is a fucking legend
Can we have the WBC every 2 years?
Really starting to like this PR team
He made a baseball move after the catch
His arm was pretty bad last year
Aww Polo is crying I feel sad now
that's exactly what I thought of
Is WBC playing by MLB rules tho?
He's playing games within his own games
He would have been out in MLB also
that wasn't a good throw though
Well Spring Training is unwatchable
Now they downvoted me Poor dudes :)
Atlanta is gonna merk Minnesota
It's like 30 feet more at AT&amp;T
I see the radar now 98 95 90 split
That's the dumbest rule I've ever heard
These guys don't know shit about José
Most unlikeliestQuality grammar
The two previous batters in the order
Dude shouldnt have bumped the ump
Isn't he more known foe his Bats
I feel nasty rooting for Bautista
If Colombia wins is the US eliminated?
BAUTISTA KEEPING CANADAS DREAMS ALIVE
Gotta love how hype DR crowds are
He's carrying 3 countries, actually
Yeah who are these guys on Mlbtv?
I LOVE YOU CORREA YOU TOO, BELTRAN
Yeah but this happened after Pablo died
Runs allowed is one of the tiebreakers
Just another day at the office for him
He didn't that was the other guy
Nah man, they won Greg Abbott told me so
We can love baseball that much :)
love the emotion of the pitcher!
I'm not sure who I want to win (US fan)
Who ARE these Colombia pitchers?
Guerrero celebrated like a muppet lol
By god our pitching staff sucks!
Haha idk I just like saying vato, vato
WHERE ARE THE TEAMCHAOS FLAIRS?
Enny Romero, Enny Romero will do
not every team has a dress code
Isn't it runs allowed per inning?
Why do they play a tiebreaker game?
John Smoltz loves the word firm
man, there's a lot of chin music
Do you have just the edge of this couch?
Ah then I take it back Makes sense
I meant on mlbtv with Cliff Floyd
Meant on mlbtv with cliff floyd
Ah that's it Knew he sounded familiar
He wants to keep his job at MLB Network
I'm watching it on a laggy stream
Should the DR pinch run for Bautista?
Welp, here we go Weird rules baseball
Wtf that was like a mile below his knees
It's like co-ed softball beer league
What a fun game, love the emotion
Extra inning Shenanigans incoming
These people play baseball like savages
I believe they are unearned runs
OH you must mean this one(♥ ͜ʖ ♥)
Whoever recorded the last 2 outs
Welcome to Wacky Baseball Fun Time!
ARE YOU SERIOUS MY TV JUST WENT OUT
starts hitting the Bunting Air Horn
For the love of God don't hit a homer
MLB better never implement this rule
Can't spell labias without bias
Same with Netherlands Japan game earlier
This new rule is slowing everything down
i thought it was because of the wall  s
THAT IS A DISGUSTING ACT!-Joe Buck
Gotta love that celebration lmao
I take it back I hate this rule
I love the passion these guys play with
He has such a fresh perspective
And why there are women at the game
I changed my mind fuck this rule
Extra inning rule feels so cheap
Feels like I'm watching a t-ball game
Idc how I just need DR to win this
Colombia will have the same runners on
They won't cause pace of play  s
Was he gonna swing at the catcher?
Launch this new rule to outer space
I was about to say that, we're spoiled
and why their ankles are showing
I'm sure they will during arbitration
3-0 he wasn't swinging at anything lol
I had to rewind for that too Wtf
This years WBC has been amazing
Hit up ESPN Deportes I got both on
Do the fans buy an all day ticket?
Can Colombia still advance if they lose?
There are a couple (plus the manager)
If Canada wins, three teams with 1-2
I like how Manny at bat there was IDGAF
Fuck the gif Give me the video!
Best case scenario after Colombias loss?
So takes away the need to play the game?
Cano's smile melts me like butter
9-3 uff Ok now I feel like I can poop
Did you watch our ALCS game in 2015?
Colombia didn't deserve to lose this way
Bases loaded, 2 outs, 3-2 count Boom!
Gah damn Just end this inning already
This stupid rule ruined a good game
This game is about to hit 5 hours lol
I meant on field bullpen, my bad
This might end in the mercy rule
Plus, the WBC is an IBAF affair, not MLB
So if DR hits a homer it's game over?
Yes, for everyone THERE'S NO LOSERS!
It's top of the inning, not bottom Lol
its no where near the same advantage
Rooting for your teeam = no class?
They just end up on the away fans
Does anyone have the Correa homer video?
Magical realism was born in Colombia
even familia can't blow a lead this big
How manu runs for a mercy rule?
With alligators in it OR SHARKS
completely agreed its a dumb rule
He looks so pleased with himself!
Wellington Castillo won this game for us
Does anyone have the Correa homer video?
You should probably try in the PR thread
Exactly The rule favors the away team
I want to be mad at you but I just can't
It is when this is implemented in MiLB
40 minute innings So much speed
What about, WAIT FOR IT, sharkgators
Oh shit You just blew my mind, friend
The Colombian players look so sad :(
You didn't even click the link, did you?
Lol at everyone thinking this is Manfred
Welp, DR's got this again this year
Why else would they put 2 runners on?
63% chance is not more often than not
Idk, its been an uphill battle for them
Just start with a 5 run lead in the 11th
I think this is the best solution
everybody needs a villain I guess
But isn't Erie on a Lake, not the sea?
He's a HOOOOOWWWLL of a good time
The launch angle on that was ridiculous
Smashed that like an Idaho potato
Vasgersian is goodSmoltz less so
Just wait until you get older and whiter
That would bean accurate assessment
If they win tonight, they're in
Win = qualifyLose = go to a tiebreak
As a guy from San Pedro I feel offended
Give the promotion staff a raise
Yes So did Gagne It's the WBC Not MLB
Must've called 'em a cocksucker
Everything you just said is incorrect
Wish they host a Pool in DR next WBC
Maybe runner on only second, 1 out?
I just came here to see if that was him
I didn't catch those What games teams?
Your best player is Michael Saunders
Who's the blonde doing the pregame?
Wait, what pitcher usage rules?
Yeah I guess you can say he's back
Give me more WBC drama I neeeeed it
i think it's kinda fun and exciting
Gotta Benedict Arnold over here!
I hope Gagne is ready to go tonight
this makes me very happy to se3
Should have started Timmy Lincecum
Stanton as an 8 is pretty weird to see
BY GAWD, THAT'S THE MOUNTIE'S MUSIC!
how the fuck is the stadium so empty?
There's the Miami crowd I'm used to
:( Desi never gets injured, this sucks
I miss the guy with the horn already
Its so peaceful without the horn guy
Pirates AA team is the Altoona Curve
Striking out the side hell yeah
He thought a fight was about to happen
Well I know a game I have to go to now
god that US lineup construction lmao
Duffy's on pace for 27 strikeouts
Canadian and American citizenship
Never let go, Jack, never let go--Avatar
how do we get the mods to sort by new
Maybe reach out to  u kyleboddy?
Favorite college baseball thing by far
Took me a whole 3 seconds to find it!
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)
Matt Vasgersian and John Smoltz?
gotta get those exit velocity stats
they have different ones for mlbtv
I will pound 4 coors lights if he does
that's definitely not Marlins Man
WHY THE FUCK IS HOSMER PLAYING!!
WHY IS HOSMER EVEN PLAYING AT ALL?
ERIC HOSMER WOULD HAVE STRUCK OUT THERE
David Dahl Chad Bettis Now you may cry
fuckin useless Hosmer why is he even in
Off brand Marlins Man right there
Hosmer proving us all wrong yet again
Dahl is only out like 2 weeks I thought?
Discount Marlins Man behind homeplate
RIP WBC Ryan Dempster 2017-2017F
RIP Dempster, don't quit your day job
Dempster didn't even last two thirds
Man, talk about a Dempster fire
Couldn't have happened to a better guy
Sorry, leafs  We must break you
we know how this one is going to end
Mods need to sticky these posts
Okwtf did Hosmer do to you guys?!
His own team did him like that?
Lick my DIck and SUCK ON MY BALLS!
What do you mean from his own dugout
Aww dempster didn't get to plunk anyone
I thought this was his second appearance
I'm surprised he recorded an out
This is how we do it in North America
Especially a loveable guy like Dempster
What is this wierd ritual of the past?
I'm sure they could stretch the joke
Boo away, home field advantage innit
what better options do they have?
So we don't feel secure until it's 7-0?
As am I I'm pleasantly surprised though
the beauty of baseballalso our BP sucks
That's a cool little moment you just had
Because that dick is perma-soft
I think it was more like, Fuck yeah!
If they lose they will need to qualify
The WBC doesn't care about the children
1 inning and about an hour later
15-0 by the 5th and I'll be good
What time did the open the gates?
Sorry I couldn't do better, Dad
Ouch  Both for Desmond and the Rockies
Where's Rheal Cormier when you need him?
Oh man, i havent watched that in forever
Strike all god damn day Fucking Russian
Jamie Romak with the in-depth analysis
These umps' calls have been a mystery
gotta throw it over the pot sometime
When does Smoltz come in to pitch?
it's weird seeing Posey in blue
DANIEL RICHARD DUFFY CAME TO FUCK
It looks like a weird acid trip
I feel like this has started filling up
This Danny guy is pretty good tbh
The earned runs thing is total bogus
I see America brought the early freedom
He should really stop saying that
Griffey Jr, ARod, and Dan the Man
Rob Refsnyder Yes, he's actually Asian
Well yeah but you know what I mean
Lake wolves would make shit mascots
He's obviously exaggerating, though
I'm all for gunning for that mercy rule
welp as long as he didn't fully quit
Did he call that a 3 run Johnson?
Or, you know, over the wall works
Let's get that mercy rule going
Lol 3 run JohnsonI see u Matty V I see u
sssssshhhhhhhhh just let it happen
They could probably beat the Canadians
Duffy's getting his work cut out for him
Canada pitching is a little shorthanded
Hosmer wouldn't have hit a double there
don't stop until the mercy rule
We're getting mercy rule'd, aren't we?
The American Non-Jews are heating up!
The American non Jews and Alex Bregman!
don't worry 3rd inning coming soon
It's, Na na na nah, na na na nah
What inning is the 10 run rule effect
Good luck at the 2021 qualifiers!
Thanks blue I thought it was outside
Not exactly a Bautista-like throw there
If we score 20 do we get Manitoba?
That throw was going to 1st base
This is turning into a curling bonspiel
This is vengeance for the War of 1812
So if USA wins is Canada the 51st state?
Only Paul Quantrill can save us now
15 runs by the 5th, 10 runs by 7th
5th, if up by 157th, if up by 10
Want that fucker off my team asap
I'm going to be generous and say the 5th
No, but you guys can have Quebec
No, even better, they stay separate
so you're saying there's a chance?
Buster Posey's good friend Eric Hosmer
Mlbtv = international broadcast
Too bad we beat you in that too
looks outside nopestill standing
I think we get their poutine reserves
Oh idk maybe he loves his parents
produce better canadian baseball players
Straight Rembrandt move right there
Bryant for the eyes test though
looks at White HouseStill standing
Non-jews that also don't eat pasta
You got everyone's panties in a twist!
isn't that the mlbtv announcers
And you guys said Duffy was good
he allowed a single PULL THIS SCRUB
Marlins man brought in some talent
Alright, we're getting to Duffy!
Now Duffy sucks, bring in Miller!
Danny Duffy is becoming Damny Duffy
what the hell is with the pitch limits?
what is this 80s trash bumper music
Why the fuck is Givens warming up?
Jesus Danny, Canada has a family
MLB protecting their investment
Duffy is a double racist confirmed
Duffman yeah Hip thrusts OH YEAH
that's it I'm trading for Duffy in OOTP
You're in for it now, Americans!
I dunno but I'm fucking into it
These commercial breaks are too long
no, the limits apply to all pitchers
Someone get Fergie Jenkins on the phone!
Crawfords hair is kind of gross
just out there representing us no 'poos
Could have beat Colombia at least
Kyle Higashioka is part Japanese
did anyone's broadcast just kick out?
I perked up when I saw this too
Fuck it give him a shot on the mound too
odds are definitely in your favour
Glad to see you're stateside, brother
Yeah, it's back, but no sound, right?
that's inevitable unfortunately
3b ump is better than anyone on Canada
FE FI FO FUMI SMELL KRAFT DINNAH
Hope to christ, MLB doesn't do this
ohh good, i thought it was my computer
Oh thank you for the gift of sound
The Cracker Cats are from Saskatoon?
It's also ahead of mlbtv for me
we only throw when babies are around
Ok time for a 22 run rally to mercy USA!
Is it a story Manfred would tell us?
Nah, he'd just signal us from the dugout
This WBC weekend has been amazing
I might have used some hyperbole
Eh I don't think those guys are enough
I don't think they cap tie like FIFA
Ahhhh before Miley went batshit crazy
And who the fuck is gonna pitch?
There's no argument for the rule
Yea but they already have one sooooo
Oh Casey Janssen, we hardly knew ye
Well the US is wrecking the ball
Holy shit Yelich's mom is a total MILF
That's Christian Yelich's mom?Holy shit
How old is Yellich's mother, 35?
Fuck off That's a fly out at coors too
Hawk is being triggered somewhere
Hello there mama yelich nice to meet you
Christian Yelich's mom is a MILF
Yellich I really like your mother
Don't underestimate the Marlins' moms
Is there a Mr Yellich Mrs Yellich?
Ya done good, Duffy, ya done good
Another scoreless inning  \FreeBregman
Holy shit, Harold was on to something
So you're saying I have a chance
DFA the whole lineup, this is sad
Is there a Mr Yelich, Mrs Yelich?
He def swings freely as he wants!
this should be the Team USA moto
It's like it's still the offseason
The fact they got on base was bad enough
At least we get to see the comments
Born in Korea, raised in California
Actually a decent crowd there by now
; hank congerHe was fun watching
Unless his arm is flipping bats
That's the Givens I like to see
Didn't know he was a member of the tribe
I don't know but that needs to happen
Yass Yass let's shit on the Mariners
parents have Canadian ties I'm guessing
shutdown canada bullpen right herr
The 2001 Mariners blew a 116-win lead
His dad is a lifelong Labatt's drinker
because your car hadn't been towed?
Something about the way he says ay-rors
A lot of good humans on this team
They won't even make it to the redzone
Danny Duffy defekkkkkkkated on Canada
Please provide a source for your claims
He'll most likely play for us, tho
This still isn't Gagne what the fuck
Josh NaylorHello darkness, my old friend
auto advance to championship round
Yes clearly I'm the one being childish
No they would not stand for this
Clear the benches and have a go at it?
Alright, i did remember correctly then
Is Morneau sedated or something?
What is all this about Mrs Yelich?
They gonna interview her about it?
Wait, there's no replay in the WBC?
He did some Kings games if I recall
I'm not Jewish I ate bacon today
I don't think they would even care
Make it 11 I love me some extra innings
The same reason that all the others are
So what's the dealio after tonight?
Posey wants enact the mercy rule
That was a moonshot Santa Maria!
it's never too late to mercy rule
Half the world can't even watch it
stanton might need to be benched
JR, I wanna see Alecia Yelich's puppies!
who was saying he should move to first?
Did he just say Craw was pinch hitting?
Or I was responding to the TV commentary
Single A club + Freddie Freeman
Yeah, that made me sad seeing 16
Puerto Rico is pretty tough too
Whoa wait the World Baseball Classic?
Rangers fan here You're full of it
Freddie Freeman, a true Canadian hero
he didn't wanna be away too long
Holy shit the commentators are bored
If KKKKKKKKKKKKKKanada scores, we riot
A pair of Encarnacion's batting gloves
Harrison's glove is sexy as fuck
Who knows how traveling works nowadays
Cliff Floyd will always be Cliff Floyd
He could have gone down with an injury?
Let's do a BBref Play Index Search!
Run rule in the bottom of the 8th
Other: mercy rule invoked in eighth
And by Wendy's (3 second pause) Beef
Arrow is pointing up on Adam Jones' 2017
Prediction: There is no 9th inning
They WANT the rematch, fuck yea
But Captain America is also in queens
Yelich's mom might top Steph Curry's mom
♫you can't hide your bryant eyes♫
At least we can get the strikeout record
Rooting for Mexico aka Team Chaos
I have such a freedom boner right now
97 with insane run Jones is fun to watch
On to San Francisco's second home park!
USA moves on to the next round!
Our friendly neighbors to the North
That would be hilarious if she did
As Kay would say, Bonus Cantos!
USA Really hope they take it all
MCDONALDS | TIM HORTONS |:--| :---|✔ |
He just seems like he's already in
Kyle Lohse is Native American Nomlaki
Que lo que &amp; what in tarnation
yeah but Mark Reynolds is actually blind
Unfortunately, he sucks with both arms
Feels more like they tried to try
I think so but I'm unsure of that detail
I Wanna Rock plays as America celebrates
dang I thought that was a grande slam
Globo de sacrificio para Mexico 1-0
Oh shit, i thought that was 2 outs  Derp
Look at this big fucker running haha
Cool and still no positive test
Petit's ERA is anything but petit now
You had to bring that shit up again
Rip Venezuela damn who saw this coming
Goooooooallll I mean  homeroooooon
I want a 15 run mercy rule by mexico!
Quiroz is the discount Jose Altuve
Mexicos jersey in general is my favorite
As an avid Altuve fan, LET'S DO IT
This counts as a win for America
But what if they both score 30 runs?
I did it a few times in high school!
What if theyre both at 69 runs?
That doesn't mean it's not a shit rule
I'll be joining the Israel bandwagon
Nah I didn't That's pretty brutal though
Nice let's get a good game going here
Agreed, but WTF is a seawolf anyway
tim hortons is american owned these days
ya I'm still unclear about some aspects
So win by 2 or more and Mexico advances?
Nah, he's coming back next season
grogger grogger grogger grogger
I'm in ur cyberz, hackin ur country
Oh yeah, that's what I meant, thanks!
Not enough evidence to overturn the call
Wow this is really neat, I love baseball
getting into mercy rule territory
We're getting colonized by Mexico
Jesus, get some pitching Venezuela
3 more runs pls My wallet needs this
You measure probability in MPH?
This is fucking perfect thank you
Check the top comment on this thread
So italy mexico tiebreaker at this rate?
They did Taillon is a non native player
Then what are you arguing about?
Lol amadore didn't score on that
Some people are into that, you know
Throw Soriano in there for a hot second
Ditto with the hat, all sold out :(
I have a raging attitude right now
Prado has been so good this tournament
As a brewers fan, im sorry guys ;_;
You fucked up Mexico Now they have hope
We're used to blown leads, right?
AND NO BIG PAPI THIS TIMENow I'm sad :-(
Just take the day off For baseball
He got it in the hole ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
is it their pitching that gave it away?
Beatiful man makes beautiful catch!
England blew a 13-0 colony lead
i never said anything about hate
I'd love to have either on my team
yea my bad, deleted my comment :)
then root for the current score to hold
I'm still in shock, what a game
They called him superstar talent :')
But why are the Mets delusional?
here comes the Venezuelan comeback!
Never change Canada never change
That was a wet noodle arm throw too
damn I missed that, I'll fix it
Faaaak  Least it was only 1 run
Team Chaos making its epic return
We will see you come hockey time
Haven't seen a great angle of that
Shit is getting interesting now
Tbf i dont think he left the base
AND ABE LINCOLN KILLING VAMPIRES!
Well  They're playing in space basically
Ok now this is just getting ridiculous
Nope  Welcome to International Baseball!
Romo is up Game over Congrats Venezuela
:books plane ticket to New York:
Cmon Miggy, this is your dream scenario
Sergio Romo is in midseason form
They can, where did you hear that?
is that salvy dancing while injured?
My chaos boner is now at 3 4 mast
it's pretty unlikely but ya maybe
Well at least someone loves their closer
Maybe one day you'll win the WBC then eh
The sound from that bat is orgasmic
So wait what's the tie breaker?
That's an AL DH if I have ever seen one
There's another Columbia it's okay
Why didn't any of them play in the WBC?
Efren Navarro is my favorite AAAA player
Well i just assume that from you&lt;3
Oh there was no pretending about it
But we all probably want to see a brawl!
Hasn't Rob Manfred taught you anything?
Even though he's a dodger now lol
Nothing strange here, move along
that doesn't have team stats, though
BALL 5 BALL 5 BALL 5 BALL 5 BALL 5
Sounds like my kind of shitshow
Red Sox-Yankees got nothing on this
or just balk on purpose to save pitches
Hahahaha oops, that's what I meant
It's those damn intentional walks
Reminds me of Bracho's arm shaking
Or lose 11-10 I guess, I'm not sure
Didn't work out so great against Italy
Venezuela, unless they only lose by one
did you just learn about the Brewers?
What a wonderful phraaaaaaaaaaaase
These games today have been fuego
P I M P    I     I    M     M    P I M P
I'm really only there for the beer
Dammit why is romo still in there?
Damn that swing was juicy as hell
Leave him in, he's doing just fine
Lol they still focus on cabrera
He wanted to flip that bat into orbit
Typical rude Cards fan  Smh  :(
Well at least its a good reason
Holy crap Venezuela is doing it
Daer boss,Fuk off m8Sencerly,Necropaw
Then they move on, no tiebreaker
Is Mexico putting Dak in the game?
Fernando Rodney looks at you confused
What a fucking perfect bunt holy shit
This inning is making me giddy!
BUNT CHEESE-  r MLBTheShow right now
Soooo they haven't been eliminated yet
Way to take one for the country!
; lit; r baseball at 10:47 PM PTConfused
NOOOIM GIVING THEM ALL MY STRENGH
bah sleep is for the regular season
Odor loves it when someone gets hit
Do it Every other game has been crazy
I'm gonna regret this, but I don't care
The World Cup of Hockey kicked ass
Ohhh thank you sweet lord baby jesus
Until were on the west coast ;_;
Oh thank God we me it out, now 6 more
and people don't like the WBC??
Beautiful women, like we've seen tonight
Scream 10 consecutive home runs pls
Team Chaos is working its magic in March
MEX is at the top of the inning though
I like this pitcher he got one out
Manager saw something he didn't like
Coming up on five hours in this game
After watching Team Canada play?
These all sound like Tim Kurkjian facts
Call me when they finish star wars world
Stupid daylights saving times  s
He wasn't really that solid at SS
Wouldn't Mexico just IBB to force a tie?
I wish MLB games had this much offense
You havent heard of that new stat?
how long has this game been going on?
Like 4 hours It feels like 10 though
The game has been up for 4 hours already
Sometimes shitty pitching is really fun
No Not the mlb network ones at least
They did but we're incorrect about it
yes (assuming it wraps up in 9 innings)
rock paper scissors because fuck it
Oliver Perez pitchingRIP Mexico
¡RemindMe  no, I don't want to know
Fuck that was a nice DP  Holy crap!
That play couldn't have gone any better
It'll take an MIT PhD to figure it out
Oh no, we're back to swinging wildly
I thought Endy Chavez used it up?
I mean, they ARE in Coors Light Stadium
It's gonna get buried, but this is great
why is Mexico only given 17 innings?
They didn't record an out against Italy
we did that it was called group D
Good thing we won't have to see that
Seems probable at this point lol
;$$$$$$$$$$$ -James Cameron probably
He's planning on putting out 4-5 sequels
Yeah but who was the Boston Bomber?
Team Chaos reigns in March AND September
That's why they play the games?
Is it partial if they didn't get an out?
Do the 'mercy' rules not apply here?
It's weird seeing Odor at third
But how are partial innings counted?
I think partial inning means 1, 2 counts
Fuck now I have to fix my spreadsheet
Shit, i have workOnly in CST tho
it would be 19 18 instead of 19 17
Vizquel should play some defense
Wait  They're not going to Italy?
Grab them right by the baseballs!
Venezuela deserves to be eliminated imo
Not after we get this walk-off win!
Let's let Trump decide by Twitter
That looked like a strike to me
Quinn Wolcott is a bit of a dick
OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS THIS UMP
long dong me out of my misery pls
Why you have to break my heart Mexico?
If Mexico loses, that ump = ded
Osuna going to be GOAT for Venezuela?
Questionable strike zone indeed
Me and this ump about to throw hands
An inhaler for when he starts choking
The classic baseball moral dilemma
nobody knows what the fuck is happening
We could have achieved world peace
No way adrian Gonzalez called that pitch
You're better off not knowing Trust me
Holy fuck come on osuna one more
Altuve must be sweating bullets rn
This is good ass baseball right now
MEXICO MEXICO MEXICOI think at least????
Osuna almost was Venezula's GOAT
Don't believe the commentators lol
Lol at Reddit thinking they know better
Fucking Altuve you're a silver slugger!
Oh my GodWhat a game What a WEEKEND
Waitdid Ven actually get eliminated????
We do know, Mexico and Italy will play
Nope, its been confirmed Venezuelas out
What time will Mexico vs Italy be?
What time is the game tomorrow?
How am i supposed to sleep now?
gg guys, see you again tomorrow night
They could just balk the runners in
Fair enough Stupid rules to be honest
It's the Steelers versus Latvia
Its only 2 here, but i know that feelz
Throw dem pizza lunchables on the field!
But then you look at the pitching staff
Mexico better be the home team this time
He's even wearing a Preds jersey lol
C O N T R O V E R S YO NTROVERSY
Or apparently are now eliminated
TEAM CHAOS HAS TRIUMPHEDI AM SO HAPPY
Holy shit, you're not making that up
Turns out they're not even the team!
I think something just died inside me
where were you when mexico was kill?
As much as I love this, we went through!
ca-nada runs may have been better
Holy shit I feel so bad for Mexico
Mexico was told they had to win by 2
That's pretty bad, like terribly bad
This is some no era penal type shit
No I'm just saying, Marilyn is one of us
\tips hatGingrich got only 20%!
Well, this sucks I am in disbelief

No, since they won a game in pool play

It's gotta be Willie and Yaz, right?

Australia doesn't have to qualify
With Chris Archer pitching in Toronto :P
Better send the ball over to Cooperstown
fair, that was pretty ridiculous
Can someone explained what happened?
my biggest hobby is commercials
I did too, thanks for linking it
Does not apply to California teams
Well I did it (technically) first
Usually between 16-18 is what I've heard
The 3rd baseman told him to to do it
This is the only plausible answer
I'll never stop being triggered
Sell the house, Skydome is your home now

He probably won't even make the team
Fastest route, the usual traffic
Frazier for Trout And prospects
How do you even dope in eSports?
This is fuckin  r baseball, mate
A 119 OPS+ since 2014 doesn't suck
Adderall to help focus on the game
I'd guess 10 years $400M at least
No, yes, maybe What do you think?
The Players Union will decide your fate
Why don't you make like the Expos
This is fantastic Thank you, Japan-Bro
Weird, must be the time difference!

When will there ever be good news?
HAS FOWLER EATEN A MAN'S FACE OFF YET?
Italy is here because of one good inning
Did you get the Jaime Moyer one back?
it's even funnier because only we get it
He made a mistake by not wrapping up
How long before the scouts leave?
I think he picked names out of a hat
This will end with a forfeit lmao
Villanova, Kansas, Kentucky, and Xavier?
;1st of 500 visits to the mound
Last place teams have to qualify
Is that who they named the surgery for?
Need a firewall to keep them out?
I like those things as well, friend
Best by far and yet were 1-2 Hmm
Pre-packaged for your convenience
I thought it said renegbed time
I'm glad the gorilla dude is there
It's good to have goals in life
Just use the rosin bag and do a LeBron
Let the first base ump call that
My man with the sly pick and eat
7th inning spin the bottle game
At least Italia is a real country
If only Germany qualified - a trifecta!
But what if Venezuela scores 10 runs?
I need some Altuve in this game
He said short memory, not Alzheimers
Plenty of good seats still available
Goddamn that a rough 4th inning
And even regular Familia has issues
everyone in attendance gets a foul ball!
So Nolan Ryan is a little bitch?
Waiting in the 2 hole( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Wow, they're really milking this
is that the milf from yesterday?
Venezuela's gonna get no hit lol
We have like 4 internal options for 1B
According to MLBcom, DR is the home team
THAT EYE LOOKS TOTALLY NATURAL!
Or Addams Family Or Daaaaaaaaayo!
Gorilla is taking em three at a time
Am I reading that box score right?
Several players still wear them
he would have died of boredom by now
So this Kershaw guy might be decent
lol like we weren't fucked already
Geez, gotta  s everything around here
How many pitchers have they used now?
Good point, never thought of it that way
This should be shouted from the rooftops
M's should hold their heads high
I can see why he'd risk it all for her
Apart from the stadium being empty?
ah of course that is very telling
How is this competition seen in the US?
Where is this game being played?
Mexicans in sports make no sense overall
No please, take Tommy instead :(
That is a play you need to make, Italy
Deloitte: we crowdsource ideas™
Venezuela just refuses to score
Italy totally did this to themselves
And Italy refuses to not help them
that's roughly the elevation of Jalisco
need me one of them ambient pitchers
Damn -- only 25 mph shy in my prime
I totally forgot that Miggy was here
Team Canada would like a word with you
oops, I totally agree with you, btw
Inciarte can really run them down
Votto isn't going anywhere though
Thomas Rawls got left out to dry man
I want this in my baseball commentary
What do you say to somebody you kev ?
I'm looking now LOL Why bother?
Mandatory 'Fuck Papelbum' 07 nevr forget
They really wanna have tp forfeit
Hahahahaha a Yets fan talking shit?!
With one less chain he would've made it
Harkening back to a simpler time
U gotta keep ur balance broheim
would Buffon be a good catcher?
Italy wants to lose this game so bad
would Herrera be a good footballer?
Get another close-up on that chick
If only Milwaukee was a separate country
I think it's down to 2 right now
Italy's 2-1 walk-off win coming
Baby momma is prettt hot though

Lol damn Jets fans talking shit
Come on Venezuela just fucking win it!!!
This game has me freaking out ITALIA
hot take, relevant username, v edgy
This guy is a right-handed Oliver Perez
Miggy homer to tie it up calling it now
Why do Italians wear gold chains?
LetUsProgressInTheUpwardDirection
I'd rather it be my man Victor!
They're basically the 2016 Diamondbacks
Not edgy just pointing out the obvious
Hope Latos turns it around this year
I give it to prado, he's been on fire
AAANNNNDDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
Who thinks Miggy will pull through?
HAHAHAHAHAH MIGGY SHOWED UP LIKE I SAID!
oh shit something finally happened
MIGGY MIGGY MIGGY, CAN'T YOU SEE?
pitcher missed demark on that one
Miggy is the best hitter I've ever seen
What is that pitch called, a Gelato?
~~Boats boats boats!~~ Runs runs runs!
WHAT LOTTERY NUMBERS DO I BUY??
So glad I renewed my MLBcom subscription
Fuck me in the asshole and call me Sally
Funniest part: the mariners had a lead
I'll do this myself, I'll even pitch!
in a minute, the game just got tied
How many guys have played in every WBC?
Runners on 1st and 2nd to start the 11th
A ton is up with Upton (hence the name)
Every time they say Odor I hear Hodor!
Inb4 high and inside, and a homer
What an uninspired call for that
And that's why you always run it out
Goddamn it Rougie, run that shit out
You jinxed it You fuck  \IBlameYou
Pimping on a long single Good job Odor
What are the ground rules for this park?
I'm here for the Italian history jokes
Not a home run, just a long single
that's why you don't bat flip idiot
More runs pls K-Rod fucking sucks
kiss your mother with that mouth odor?
Replace the air horn with a vuvuzela
Like the Grand Slam Single but way worse
More runs, I have Venezuela -15
didn't he get hurt the other day?
Whatever it was was also on his tongue
Ya, he's ok it was just a cramp
I'd rather that they get it right
Odors face ive made a terrible mistake
ITALY GONNA COME BACK AND WIN THIS THING
That's the video that inspired my post!
It made the same call as the umps
The man failed to save the game
The city would literally shut down
Haha im pretty biased, not gonna lie
Do the cool kids still say toke?
Those cleats are something else
I'm surprised Odor got to third
Jesus how fucking slow is CarGo now
Should be 4 2 if Odor wasn't a moron
Odor could have scored from second
MY FAVORITE PLAY IN ALL OF BASEBALL!
Guys, Venezuela is beating Italy!
Yeah they didn't expect that at all
At least he didn't get thrown out at 2nd
I miss me some Roogie bat flips
And a few real Italians apparently
May his holy right hook bless us
He's the heel that we don't deserve
Got enough dip in there Rodriguez?
This bullpen is really deep right guys?
God damn that was a monster dong
If Venezuela loses I'm laughing
Did the feed just die for anyone else?
ESCOBAR is showing his inner Crawford
Italy hops behind wheelOH GOD NO
I want to get off mr WBC's wild ride
Glad to see Liddi peraonally hit that
Great play by Escobar Great dig by Miggy
Nice try Gavin, but good play Escobar
Feed's down for me what the hell
What happened to the MLB Network stream?
YOUR UBER WILL BE HERE IN 5 MINUTES!
The stream went to a commercial break!

ALMA LLANERA playing in the stadium
Hats off to Italy tho, heck of a team
USA vs Venezuela this oughta be good
This WBC has been off the chain, so far
To rafael furcal in the first lol
Boy have I got the subreddit for you
Does it happen to be  r hockey?
I meant to say he used to throw 100
Group of death Only 2 can move on
I heard he was still wearing his pads
Billy Martin's spectre would be proud
He wasn't  I wanted Italy to win
So did the 2007 Orioles against Texas
I know Super pumped for real baseball!
Victor not having it is my favorite part
;Only give me answers that I like!
You'd better treat Edwin right!
Ummmm he didn't pitch well at all?
\eats gnocchi in despair(true story)
Currently, Masahiro Tanaka comes to mind
Matt Adams could totally mash at coors
Yea fantasy land is to the right of it
Florida would have the Cubans, no?
Those guys always have top tier signs
Doesn't kershaw hit mid upper 90s?
Rockies be like, hows your neck Prince?
Too bad we're probably gonna trade him
JoFer would have been a good answer, too
A Yankees fan posting about Buhner?
It was gonna be a good summer :(
The Warthen slider is addictive
And, ya know, banging Drew Barrymore
Don't count out the Rockies and Twins
I definitely recall seeing at least 97
I'm just waiting for the Vedder cup
you really showed him who's boss
Ya but who was player of the game?
It's only weird if it doesn't work
You'd have been upvoted in  r NFL
Don't let him hit, don't let him swing
Mike trouts career ops is under 1000
2 or 3 hours of more concession stands
Yea, about that other teams thing
We can all drink to Fuck the Yankees
Very observant, you have a keen eye
I don't know what I expected :c
Man, you were on all those teams?
At least we're not Oklahoma City
Then everything started getting mediocre
Or he's just really bad at hiding it
This is going to be a good game
3 hours flight south from u whats up?
Oof Better for him than a DP though
Not happy, but at least we got the out
Cool Thanks for clearing that up
well their spirits probably died
When he's healthy which is almost never
He plays really well in this tournament
And Eric Thames didn't get a single AB?
What the hell is this nonsense?
Much cheaper than I expected Thank you
I want the Brewers back in the AL
So many tight ass games this WBC
Ya'll shouldn't have traded Venditte
Rocky Mountain HIIIIIIIIIGHHHHHHHHHH!
GODDAMN TOKYO DOME GIGANTIC WALLS
This Japan vs Cuba game has been awesome
This week on Jose Reyes is a scumbag
2nd and 3rd place play a tiebreaker game
I think Kikuchi could make it too
u marinersofficial y'all ok over there?
So excited for the PR vs DR game!
Somehow, they'll blame Mike Trout
I think the IBAF sets the rules
The Pirates liked to chant Cueto!
The guy who punched Bautista in the face
Clearly we need to pick up Lawrie
Looks like maturity growth is for 2017
Seager, have you seen that grin?
Best worst pitcher in O's History
Japanese baseball has songs and chants?
Unanimous MVP and 3-1 and such and such
lololololol was about to say this
New stadium will be pretty cool!
My dude put it on his wrist lmao
Some of the hardest throwers are lefty??
Get this guy over here already!
Honestly I hope so, Beer me fam
You're right, that was pretty cool
Beltran over Beltre  The fuck is this?
Again, I'm tired of talking about it
Oh man this hits too close to home
Every player wants to get their licks in
Wild Thing would make a comeback
They just hosted la serie del Caribe tho
I agree, but the stadium is still money!
So it's Manny being Manny wearing Manny?
O'DAYYYY ODAY ODAY ODAY OODAY OOODAY
Nah, fuck Odor, he's a hypocrite
It's a 9u team in a 10u tournament
He's got a great name for baseball
How did I know this was coming up
You're one of today's lucky 10,000
And it put his team up late in the game
Assuming there actually is a next WBC
Wish he had been there this year
He'll be re-evaluated in a week
The Washington Nationals' season
;Melky as a BraveWe try to forget that
People don't like when we have fun :(
Only 324 games are possible since 2015
It is Kenta Maeda's interpreter
A healthy Mets team is scary like Gary
Learn to hold a fucking fork, Matz
I could've been more clear in the title
Everything about this guy is annoying
What's your opinion on pitching wins?
Clearly the a's can get on base
It would work as an occasional thing
That Stanton split is ridiculous
Game 2 (Cuba-Japan) should be added
Oh, is that what we're gonna do today?
Too little too late you commie!
And all the money Houston spent on Brock
What the fuck is going on today?
I often wonder how Drake is doing
Maybe I know in Florida and Texas we do
Jesus, how far is it to center?
They're the Seattle Coldsteels now
Dude, calm down It's just a game
Blue Jays sleeper agent confirmed!
God, free Wifi would be awesome
it's spring training for all of us
But on the first pitch of the AB?
I don't really see the problem?
And Eric gagne throwing 90mph+ heaters
With all due respect to the Killer
Aaaaaaaand I'm voting Mets apparently
i have plenty of hate to go around
;San DIego PadresELIMINATE THE TYPO
ever been up into the mountains?
Holy shit, that last one is amazing
Very impressive indeed He's got me beat
I like his monster singles more
Don't disrespect the opponent's goalie
Don't be anything like Steve Avery?
Blah blah blah money wasted on Osweiler
What does his height have to do with it?
odd numbered year = Nationals failure
2016 is his entire career though
MBFAor BFLK, bat flip like a Korean!
Those are some nice mental gymnastics
what do people have against the rangers?
I'm not sure this addresses the question
Whoa there It was 1 half great season
He certainly gives of a noxious Odor
It's the only stat the matters!
Lol how tf did I forget it was Sean?
yea the video was posted here already
None of that was presented as opinion
Good god that's hard to look at
I mean there's nothing stopping anyone?
We don't need it, you're already there
Suprised I don't see cespedes anywhere
That's bad, beyond the scope of the game
I almost died It was on my birthday too
Did the Rockies just win something?
Uh, no Hockey fights are by far the best
Is that not Blackmon second in line?
They don't They have 6 45 lb plates
Fucking wow 8 upvotes already too
Yeah but how much can Drake deadlift?
Yep  Your username paints a vivd picture
Are you a Yankees fan or something else?
Very well put I completely agree
Thank you English is my second language
No problem, I could've worded it better
Is this a newspaper of televised?
maybe if you're attracted to thumbs
He was negative everything last yeae
We still have it at Rogers Centre
He was just that for a lot of teams
Oooooooh how do you respond Sparx?
KILL THE ORIOLES Who's with me?
Me before clicking the link Is it will?
Trout isnt even top 10 handsome in mlb
Give the guy a hand  Job well done!
Okay, have you ever heard of a bat flip?
And somehow, their bullpen would blow it
Is that what those red veins were?
It's photoshopped but still nifty
That second one should be a suspension
Bruh, pretty sure Auston plays hockey
; Oh, is that what we're gonna do today?
You didn't think that ball was gone too?
Jesus fucking christ that's awful
Ah, nope was talking about odor still
It's only fair  It's a top name
There's a reason he named his kid Taz
Yeah, he got swept in the playoffs
Don't know, but I wish they'd do it
No ones surprised to see Aaron Judge?
He's playing for a future contract
Don't pitch shit, can't get hit
imo it just looks more like a dick move?
THAT'S MY BOY JOE FUCK YOU ODOR
yo i really liked this good work
I suppose you can view it like that
I saw Puig hit a lead off triple (?)
So he struck 'em all out looking?
I hate Odor That was at least a double
A quick google search says he was 14
He hits every ball at exactly 1149 mph
this broken narrative will never die
Someone's been playing Baseball Mogul
You didn't even mention Trea Turner
I thought he was an outfielder lol
Please keep editing your comment
God I hate these kinds of jokes
I'm saving this This is amazing
Keep Shin Soo Choo out of this!
Just picking up where he left off
You obviously don't watch much hockey
I believe it was Robin Ventura (ChiSox)
Big Sexy would've been digging for 3
Because he doesn't hit the damn ball
I justI just can't contain my excitement
It's okay bro Just breathe Inand out
I think he's only comparing AL SS
;So they get on base a lot so what?
So how bad is this ballpark actually?
How is Brandon Crawford's age relevant?
What contrived argument is that?
Like a more handsome Jason Giambi
The US team are a bunch of buttercuppers
But that's why I don't like him!
Exactly Nearly anyone can play OF
Your manifesto appears to be incomplete
Picked as if it was college baseball
I read this as aids game Seemed right
settle bro, no need to be insecure
And no mortal man could've stopped him
i'm not sure that department exists
RIP Runs DMC (Donaldson, Moss, Cespedes)
Heck, he's played eight games at CF
Man do I miss that goofy bastard RIP
How do we know they are fake though?
and frazier to replace ellsbury
Hey this is my dream lineup not yours :)
let the bats starting flipping out!
Damnit MLB, it's Lamigo not Lamingo
I liked when he knocked his own team out
flair up if you're gonna talk shit
Don't worry he's a lil bitch boy
Fuck it we gonna shutout the DR!
this game is gonna be incredible
AAAANNNNDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
I really love Yadier Molina lol
Already this game is too lit for me
Why are these threads not stickied?
Nervous to hype as fuck instantly
Trevor Rosenthal's k 9 comes to mind
Yeah, stick to Mlb network if you can
That synchronized fist bump tho
I'm having such a dilemma right now
I can't wait till Yadi bats against him
It's upped to 80 for this round
That's The Big Dog Orlando Roman Reigns
Crawford is a big shortstop, no?
Yadis celebration was everything lol
C O M M U N I C A T EOMMUNICATE
Little nod of respect from Martinez
Molina vs Martinez  This is great!
Molina is gonna give him so much shit
He bleached his beard because he is bald
That would have been for the 2nd time
Momentum is real, ladies and gentlemen
I love this team, makes me hard
Public Relations lead the Doctors
It makes him look 20 years older
lets get that run back and then some!
Should've held these games in NY
P O L A N C O OLANCOI S S E X Y
Is that a cultural thing in PR?
He's also cheering against a Cardinal
Then he deserved to be fought too
uh don't think that was a home run
Time to put laser cutters in the fences
Please ban all fans from baseball games
Since when did the Rays pay players
They don't realize they're reaching over
Can confirm: am sick to stomach
u burialisfourtet is also beautiful
lol come on he clearly reached over
Aw, thanks You're beautiful too
I mean Umps are the worst no matter what
Matty V just shitting on the Expos rn
My beautiful baby giraffe❤️
What a great fucking start to this game
It's like when Bugs Bunny plays baseball
Are you sure that wasn't a homer?
280 350 450  25-30 Homers 75-85 RBI
Do u have the link to the post?
I'm rooting for the US territories
Oh, the cowbells, and horns, OH MY
Lol, what are you talking about?
Would have been a single for posey
TJ still swinging at everything
We need PR and USA in the finalswin win
Castro to Martinez: Throw strikes
As long as Altuve is left off base
Nobody doesn't need Lindor &amp; Correa
WBC is the hero this world truly needs
Based on the first 3 WBCs - we do
This is important question, pls answer
Netherlands - Cuba starts at 11:00?
Where do you think it should have been?
Bautista expected words, not fists
Just pay his vet bills and hes all yours
Geez this dude can't throw at all
bartolo would have gotten it out
In a normal ballpark, we're down 4
Bronx Bomber Get it right, playboy :)
Polanco touched the ball HYPEEEEEEEEEEE
Correa went full war paint tonight
That's another 9999 to Cardinals oh
Correa has not been playing so hot :(
MACHADO CARAJO Wtf is that Beltré?
This tournament is defense porn
AAAANNNNDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
That sexy homer against Italy though
He let Javy make him pretty tonight
And I would happily read that fanfic!
What the heck is on Baez's face
Bruh PR eats as much plantains as DR
Why was the victim laughing too?
I was hoping Kevin Matian was Haitian
Like a ball flying through soup
Exactly like what's the point in that
Dominican Rico vs Puerto Republic hype
the tattoos are a little weird though
Did someone leave a foghorn on?
Steal my baby giraffe you can do it
Drink every time Morosi says gracias
Yadi looked so mad he dropped the ball
Como si se le cagaron en la madre
Pero like, había chicharrón en Africa?
I can't tell if you're joking or not
not like it's a large crowd sadly
then why doesnt he play for Team Texas?
and the manager saids Thank You
Nah, you probably wouldn't do shit
The barbed wire is kinda terrifying
NO IT'S THE SAME GUY  DUDE COME ON
Fuck that wall man that was a triple
That dude is the fucking man haha

Yadi is one of my least favorite humans
Ugh, I hate that I love him He kills us
Ah dam now I got this fear in my head
Still grabbing this game by the balls
1 random Benjie clone per league
I love the emotion from all these guys
Puerto Rico blows a 3-1 lead confirmed
Its dumb, but that's not the point
This guy is a poor man's Chapman
He's 137 years old Cut him a break
Lindor giving me division flashbacks
This ump has an appointment to get to
fuck yes yadi you're framing so so good
Screw you forever but well played friend
I don't whine about it at least

It's platinum blond, thank you very much
Just throw balls and get strikes
tbh all I heard were the naughty words
I'm on the other feed, what'd they say?
Dion Waiters approves this message

Sí Their jerseys also say Dominicana
Have you played All-star Baseball 2004?

Did Cruz try walking to 2nd base?
Lo que no tenemos hoy es madre coñaso
Holy shit hes got PR on his back rn
CońasoCońaso All over the place
Why do people still try to run on YADI?
LMAO why would you run Cruz on yadi
Was that a no look catch and tag?
What can you not learn from the show?
DR vs The Autonomous Territory of Yadi
Why does Nelson Cruz of all people?!?!
It's a boner Don't worry me too
they have park feed for WBC too
Baez not even looking at the tag
defensive version of the bat flip
Why look when you're omniscient?
Decisions were made And they were bad
I'm in the us Are the games blacked out?
Yadi+Baez is the stuff of dreams
Kinda want a pinch hitter for Beltre
4) Yadier Molina is the catcher
Is that CS an honorary TOOTBLAN?
Pal de cocotaso for the ump after this
So much for glorified spring training
so, Beltre leads off the 9th with a hit?
Cruz was just protecting his closer
They could fill 3 Yankee Stadiums
Ugh now Betances is going to walk guys
Hope not They respect themselves
Puttin some beef into that throw
Welington Literally Yadi Castillo
Damn that was great from Machado
That was a great sweep tag from Machado
We got catcher porn tonight boys
How do you pimp a defensive play?
Can anyone translate what Machado said?
I wanna be just like him when I grow up
I want this shit in the regular season
Lots of these guys actually It's awesome
He knew it would've been a called strike
Cano makes that shit look so easy
He's been my favorite player since 2010
AAAANNNDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
Yadi learning from Matt Adams I see
GIMME SOME OF THAT SWEET SWEET SUGAAAA
nah Yadi loves first pitch swinging
Is Brandon Belt a baby giraffe too?
We got Jacoby Ellsbury thoo :'(

Netherlands add another in the 4th, 8-0
Goddamnit Eddie D is supreme filth

Strikezone has been atrocious all night
What the hell are these pitches?
Castillo better help out Polanco
I don't know -Home plate umpire

OK thank you Glad I'm not crazy
Twice, on his run to second too
Eddie Rosario is the MVP of this game
His mom looks kinda light skinned
Have yourself a night, Yadi My goodness

Yadi Molina defeats Dominican Republic
What a fitting pitch to end the game on
That's fucking absurd what is that call

What a way to end it PAAATHETIC
Puerto Rico did not blow a 3-1 lead
That ump is absolute trash my god
Umpire must have a hot date tonight
That is how this game would end
Courtesy of the Home Plate Umpire
Bats' sad face looks familiar wonderful
Motherfucker just threw a 99mph slider
I love Jose's wtf howd we lose face
Never mind closer than it looked
This is also an American victory
Diaz has some disgusting stuff, goddamn
lmao what the fuck was that last pitch?
Ump can't handle Yadi's pitch framing
Only if you then got thrown out at first
Interesting game that's for sure
Felix Trinidad defeats Joan Guzman
Call was alright Justified strike call

Cuba about to get mercy ruled, damn
I see I've been beaten to the 3-1 meme
How does that disprove anything?
WE DID IT WBC OVER FOLKS LETS GO HOME
This is just getting painful now
Dont be sorry that guy is an asshole
This game could end before 2 hours lol
That's a strike with that k zone
The earlier game was way better
I'm talking about the home plate ump
Yeah what the heck was that about
Aus, China, Cuba, Japan So kinda
gotta love the best eyebrows in baseball
That not even one of his bad ones
I think you can stop watching that game
I deserved it, I even downvoted myself
Yadi Molina getting the Jose Molina zone
Profar going shopping at the GAP
You've just discovered why they do it
That girls' Balentien chant was adorable
Thank you very much I understand now
they should have lost to Australia
Me too, but I can't say I'm displeased
They've been at every game Same outfits
Burt Blyleven was everyone's dad in 1982
I'm fine with this Fuck the wave
WHATS THE SAVES RECORD IN THE WBC?
Puerto Rico beating up on the DR

Well, this is my new favorite video
ya sorry english is my first language
A Beltran double-play but he was safe
Please baseball gods let cuba be mercy'd
Looks like the ump drank your beer
But holy smokes would that lineup be fun
Wonder if it was a botched hit n run?
I was thinking Megan Fox's toe-thumb
Hopefully 4 more outs to end the game
Or a few Netherlands runs Either or
Whoa, hot girls in the crowd alert!
players wives and girlfriends I assume
Please show more pretty Dutch girls

Fidel Castro didn't die for this
;THE KINGDOM OF ~~NETHERLANDS~~ BAMBAM
There's a baseball bat in Hotline Miami
pleased discomfort unites us all
I made them all once the WBC started
Is it weird that I'm not suprised?
fuckin rude, guy has confidenceso what
Hey, a Twins player did a thing!
He made 8 more errors than the next guy
Wonder how much he'd make as model
Archer Quintanas would disagree
Especially in the 7th and 8th inning
How do you assign value to players then?
Kinda pissed that was called a ball
Where are all the Balentien haters now?
The NFL has the same arrangement though
I ain't even mad at this comment
Currently active and sure fire?
The team atmosphere is really great!
hey we got 1 on the fangraphs list
Mariner pitcher beats Mariner hitter
and thus pulling an Odor was born
Yeah but it's a Friday's in a ballpark
Maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't!
Only whiskey and tequila for me
Ok, I'm up and watching  Let's do this
I thought he said Who the fuck is this?
That was a massive jack by Tsutsugoh
Damn Tsutsugō What a tournament he had
People are fantastically fucking stupid
The atmosphere is insane, I love it
Damn Israel is just falling apart
The intentional walk died for this
Well, we had a great run Fun two weeks
OH UGH FUCK NO MY PACE OF PLAY IS RUINED
How to beat the Israeli Baseball Team
Beautiful strike out pitch by Katz
I really want to see Japan vs USA
Lol That's not doing much of anything
Would they have eliminated the US or DR?
Totally forgot about Ichiro He's in
$100,000 is a lot bigger than zero
I think it's unfair that this is allowed
I don't like the Phillies but you I like
Wow that's just hilariously dumb lol
Axis Powers trash, Central Powers better
Japan, once the 6th started: Roku'n Roll
They don't use SABR stats too much
Lol the ignorance of people sometimes
They did win twice already though haha
Ah true, yeah just Aoki this time haha
Well this is getting interesting
For the love of God, don't try to steal!
Weaver, Verlander, Halladay, Cliff Lee?
God I love these kinds of jokes
We love the Mets, but we're afraid!
I thought he was out for 2 weeks wtf?
Baez is pretty unique, no doubt about it
you've been holding onto that one
This thread is too fucking real
For example, 37 year old Ryan Braun
Yeah Robbie Ray is definitely in
Live in Puerto Rico, Can confirm
what did Mr Hernandez do to you?
They need to bring Papa Doc back
PR are our rivals in everything
u petevonpete rejoices as well!
he was clearly talking about Robbie Ross
Whoa that's some level of math there
Machado and it's not even close
unlike the Dark Knights parents
Who's gonna be their first string?
It's baseball but even more fun
Rangers do that better than anybody
Isis that Rowan Atkinson in the stands?
Dang that sucks Dont come back here tho
; It was never special Hard disagree
Dude drills ballsusually into the ground
I don't want to brag or anything buuuuut
Yadi catching Doesnt matter who pitching
Australian BaseballYou go to 3rd 1st
Jean Segura is not a slow dude at all
He's honestly so damn fun to watch
He's nearly unhittable in MVP 2005
You might even say that it Israel
Ahaha didn't even realize Still works
They're called Samurai Japan, so yes
Hmm didn't realize that Do you know why?
The brawl that made everyone happy!
Are the votes consistent every day?
What do you think the word owned means?
Wouldn't that make him faster to 2nd?
Grote Honkbal Competitie rather :D
That doesn't actually work, does it?
Fighting guarantees citizenship!
Are you owned by your employer?
But why not get rid of Lobaton?
Here's to my hope of a US - Japan final!
And the players are called honkballers!
He should start stealing 1st base
Or a god knows how old Jason Marquis
Everyone is at fault but Yadi, sure
An eye injury is the most common route
Wait are all the players priests?
it has me all kinds of confused
No one's forcing you to visit this sub
He complains about everything though
The ball wasn't juiced  There I said it
; Bam Bam MuelensNow THAT's a name
Jobu can if you don't steal his rum
Well after that fight, they should be
Only if he holds me instead of the bat
You forgot Garambe 100 career HR's
Don't think that would be too fair
The only shonde is George Soros
Pujols is also 9 home runs away from 600
Oh sweet, I'm on the fast track
Shenanigans, I call it on the WBC!
Casey Candaele is the fucking man!
You've set the bar very low for death
So a harder-throwing version of myself?
Halp, im agreeing with a Cubs fan
Ah, the Hendrix followed by the R Kelly
Israel winning would have done that
The responses by the A's were kinda lame
Personally I think they're super corny
You know you can get a vpn right?
Brian McCann would like a word with you
Same but for the Happy Gilmore one
Congrats on getting fucked in the ALCS
Isn't that the point of a fight?
Lol, wow they both have 4379k followers
; intentional walkintentional HBP
I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE
That's rich coming from a Dodgers fan
Is his whining resume extensive?
Yes Canadians were better organized
Javier Baez has so much fucking swagger
Fuck FIBS&amp;nbsp;(Viva il baseball)
That Netherlands hat is great I'd buy it
That's pretty coolMay I have it?
Skip Madison Source: I live there
I loved the one where (Buhner?)
Mariners fans just want an escape
The commercials are better than the team
Naturally it'll come against the Rangers
I wonder who's responsible for that?
Does that make 2nd base home plate?
Surprised if that hasn't happened before
Thanks for distracting me from work
I did With them out I changed back
Makes sense that nintendo owns them
M's commercials are always good
Mexico's looks like a Minecraft item
At least the nationals got out before us
Man I miss Lomo He was such a cool guy
jesus christ that exit velocity
He ain't wrong on the first bit
The dopest swing there ever was
They're a really fun niche band
Sure but strange isn't necessarily bad

Holy shit thank you I was very confused
Let's do this Orioles haters!!!
Hey Lerners this is your chance

He is literally living my dream
FYI the b in bWAR is Baseball Reference

I'm not even a Sox fan and I want this
Only because they were scary polygamists
Jesse Orosco deserves a wing here
Way better than the Toronto fan box
Cricket basically is Calvinball to me

Oh shit, he can strike out all 27
We gotta do some winning somewhere!
I was curious as well Great show, though
Gives it a hay, wants to be a hero!
Oooh  Red pin stripes  Edgy  I like it
What kind of name is Todd Gack anyway?
That doesn't sound right either
Was it ever really a good thing?
The Netherlands send their regards
Was hoping for an Always Sunny reference
And a pretty decent basketballoh wait
Unless it's Jose Molina, then you're set
Gotcha I dunno how I missed that
Ugh that hurts my heart It was so pretty
People do weird things sometimes
Is that a young Toby Flenderson?
That was a fun game even though we lost
Pretty much a meteor at that point
That poor soul never had a chance
All teams are almost guaranteed 55 wins!
You can't spell 'Wladimir' without 'W'
It only gets weirder Go Astros!
Fuuuck that would've been way more sick
This somehow makes me understand it less

Blue Jays are looking like real chumps
About 60% from 3 of the 81 home games
It's like Irish Cr1tikal I love it
He's got a HOF Fan Club, though
Why the fuck isn't Crawford starting
Why the fuck is smyly starting?
Archer went back to the rays camp
Is Odor really the 3rd baseman?
Well that's one way to start a ballgame
Ideal result: 1-0 US win, unearned run
God damn that is a good article
Is this Miguel guy supposed to be good?
That was an aggressive strike call
That's a very aggressive strike call
Must be a gardener cuz I heard he rakes
You can still go see anthony gose
Chicago is too cools this time of year
I bet some are still run by locals
I wonder if Yelich's mom is there
Too bad you can't do that in the NFL!
What's the pitch count this round?
so it's gonna be like that, Felix?
Get him the fuck out of the game
Jayson Nix26 bWAR over 7 seasons
Felix has worse ankles than Steph Curry
I would like to hear from Mama Yelich
This is gonna blow your mindwe do
Stop hitting it to Felix right now
Damn we're trying to kill Felix lol
Right he's not Canadian after all
Lol Felix with the shitty luck inning
Keep your glove on, silly goose!

Also, everyone upvote the thread!
Jonathan Lucroy with tha buttahfngers
Nah, I love ridiculous umpires lol
I meant just the baseball redditors
Only shooting stars break the mold
where's Shawn Green when you need him?
What is attendance for a game like this?
I cringed so hard at that throw :(
Free Agency Yankee fans wait for it
Little heat on that one to first
That throw looked bad from the start
solid 12-6 on that throwing error
I knew that sailed as soon as he let go
And now its Altuve Guaranteed RBI
Wait wait wait No posey or crawdaddy??
Man the field mics are really hot
But that's basically all of reddit

WORK WITH ME HERE THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL
LEYLAND SUCKS THIS LINEUP ORDER SUCKS
We got a live one over here boys!banned
Our lineup construction is stupid af
Not sure if Adam Jones, or Justin Smoak
They're practically Canadians already
Go America All Over Their Asses
Can Leyland stop making shitty lineups?
It was only half inflated at best tbf
Yeah, just like us in Toronto have oh
I don't give a fuck, I'm happy for felix
Does the WBC have replay challenges?
Me: FUCK YEAH THAT'S MY SHORTSTOP!!!
Smoak would've at least only struck out
Should have come with a WS ring replica
Keep rocking the axe handle bat
Pence and Morse finally kissed?

Nothing penetrates theMARINE LAYER!!
How are you disappointed in October?
What's the pitch limit for this round?
Felix is an expert on the Marine Layer
He's the ariana grande of baseball
Not a fan of difficulty increasing
I find this lack of offense disturbing
Well it was 80 degrees here today
Don't force it mate, give us some time
It took you 7 games to beat a AAA team
Well you CAN - you shouldn't :)
Felix Hernandez always looks so sleepy

do these scrapes look like stigmatas?
The accuracy was, but not the strength
Yea I was really let down by that
Red Sox and White Sox would be Pink Sox
I like the Chicago White Indians

But salads are generally pretty low carb
Slow down there, Teddy Roosevelt
We doing this thread again today?
Win your games if you want to advance
the hat THE HAT WHERE DO I GET THAT HAT
Arenado gets talked about a ton here
Not bad he's no Nick Swisher though ;)
Saved you a click guy, you da real MVP
Why do you think he is a douche?
That was a religious experience for me
Now it's actually slightly more racist
Those Americans are so jingoistic
Yankees + Red Sox = antimatter explosion
Removed We literally did this yesterday
Better than the Cincinnati Red Indians
EhThat John Denver is full of shit
Exactly, even more of a damn commie!
Still the prettiest damn swing ever
Seattle and Miami = The Iron Born
Pedro Steroid Era Just look at the ERA+

The Los Angeles Angers  of Anaheim

;1996-2330What a long and storied career
DH  Fenway  Yeah, it's goddamn absurd
I agree it's still disappointing
Why read long when you can assume short
This issue has been talked to death
Why you standing like that though?
Is struck out by three fastballs
But then Fulmer doesn't win ROY
Glad you had a great time at MMP!
how have I not seen this until now
TRADE BELT MOVE POSEY TO FIRST!!!!
What did the Reds do to Basebally?
ITT: well known superstars of the game
Mariners + Pirates = Pittsattle Seamen
Their batting gloves are fingerless
I bet he'd make a good tight end
The first two spots on our rotation
aka Flat Breezy aka The Brim Reaper
Probably had better days at the ballpark
He just left the east coast spotlight
Gary Sheffield is the most iconic
Must suck to be the third seager brother
Famous athletes don't know him!
The Cardinals + Rockies = the CarKeys
and I'm all like, Go Buster Posey?
Looks like he really has to pee
manslaughter is pretty close to murder
Expect 2 quick outs and then a meltdown

Because mine didn't, USA won :'(

Kind of like their owner, heyooooo
Our TWTW is severely underrated
I'd take 37M to be mediocre for 22 years
The other part seems to be pretty good
Oh derp Didn't even realize that
Some of you act like John Lackey
How does one even develop that stance?
You knew exactly what you were doing
Pronounced RAH-yals or ROY-keys
Maybe the Jays starting pitching?

That was freaky, but kinda explains alot
GOD DAMNIT WHY WOULD YOU SWING AT THAT?
I knew that was going to happen
Nice DP to get out of the inning
He's  gonna get paid by someone else
And for this reason I'd also say JA Happ
I don't know Is it bad luck to eat it?

Lugo's Pitches are looking dirty
Murphy just pretend its the dodgers
Lmao I went to the Mother's Day(?)
Killing rallies, the American way
Daniel Murphy does not drive stick
So why no challenge system in the WBC?
not his fault the ump fucked him
Do WBC players get paid at all?
Crawford is batting after Murphy
Why the fuck is stroman still pitching?
Murphy could have ran harder there
Only in the final round is there replay
That out was reparations for Colonialism
Murphy and stroman confirmed un-American
Good news is they're now down 4-1!
Thanks My researching was subpar lol
Field of stars always faces forward
It happened to Beltran last game tho
He was pretty good for maybe a week

So USA wanted to start off on hard mode
Alright, let's keep chippin' away

Now that was a good half-inning
Yeah like that one mercy rule call

Ouchpoor Buster, that smarts :(
Arenado has been terrible in the WBC
Goldschmidt would have scooped that
Carlos Correa The On Base Devil
Blues knees buckling a bit there
Goldschmidt would've made that out
The balls are ball seekers tonight
Are there different announcers in MLBtv?
Extra inside pockets for bags of Cheetos
I didn't know Mike Trout was Jewish
Goldschmidt would have nabbed that
If only Correa had Murphy's awareness
So why didn't the throw go to first?
Scoring and reddit game threads
general internet surfing + weed
You can stream on their website
How did he not break is leg there?
Goldschmidt would have caught that
Insert fuck marine layer comment here

Doesn't matter, chicks dig the long ball
Rougned Odor isn't playing today
Alright, Cutch Time for a hit, dude
Fuck you for insinuating I'm calm  s
THAT UMP IS COMMUNIST AND RACIST!
This ump needs to be tried for treason
I'd rather see Stanton in there anyways
I'm with cutch on this one Shit call
Jesus that ump got his feelings hurt
Dodgers last year he threw his bat
Having a quick hook in a WBC game?
Are these replacement umps or something?
So he didn't even say the F word?

GOD BLESS AMERICAGOD BLESS ADAM JONES
Agreed by having a Swish Yankee jersey
So is Will Little's wife Puerto Rican?
Where is your glove now, Correa?
how was that so close Lindor you beastie
Arenado is pretty slow for being so lean
It's okay, Lindor grabbed it for him
The US, coming from behind since 1776
Nolan Arenado has an enormous bulge
All that isn't worth anything though
I mean you gotta love Javy Baez though
Hope we come back and win tonight!
Shit I'm not even mad, that's amazing
Do the Yankees allow hair coloring?
Fuck man, Baez is so damn good goddammit
Might put him in at DH for Murphy
Allegiances aside, that glove is so sexy
Man this PR infield is so fun to watch
Hang on boys we got ourselves a game
Just ordered the Halfliner  Thanks!
A hipster would never admit he hates it
At least we got something going on
Depends on what video games you play
Oh, now he can tell what a ball is
That could have been a lot worse
Watch your fucking language, Javy
I'm sorry Javy we didn't mean it :(
Damn, Baez went super saiyan right there
Phew, it hit the knob of the bat
When did Baez get hit in the jaw?
thank fuck for the knob of that bat
Naw Grazed his arm before the bat
Givens is insanely slow to the plate
You can change pitchers mid at bat?
Car Insurance, kinda like Geico maybe?
So Javy Baez went to high school in Jax
Your pizza stinks, end of story
I didn't know you could do that
In attendance Having a fucking blast
if it hits the bat first its a foul ball
Can't get rid of it much faster
Maybe he thought he had quick counts on
OUR STARTING LEFT FIELDER REEEEEEEEE
Givens gets charged with the BB
27 wins for the best team in the league
TJ, ILY but hit into a triple play
pol 's favorite ballplayer is up to bat
its hard to have an AB worse than that
Miller is so fucking filthy my god
Buster King of Presentation Posey
Holy shit that pitch should not be legal
Nope, as much as I enjoyed that
Here comes the cheat code slider
Posey throwing it all over the lot
50 Cent esque in his throw to 3rd
Shoulda called for a throw over
At least it didn't go into left field
That was a fucking huge steal tho
FINALLY that low zone works for us!
God damn Miller is fun to watch
Psycho Javy about to steal home
Getting those make up calls Thanks blue
Posey moved that pitch like 10 inches
Why is Angel always this lucky lol
Probably making up for the last one
But are you a handsome, handsome man?
Andrew Miller really sucks - Jim Leyland
Arenado has been fucking terrible
Arenado is costing us this game
Hosmer got eaten up on that attempt
NOLAN HAMMER AND SICKLE ARENADO
Man Arenado has had a rough tournament
1) god damn pagan 2) god damn nolan
I blame the goddamn marine layer
One step forward, two steps back
Hosmer - if nothing else, stop the ball
Why not bothTrout and Kershaw please
Little column A little column B
No argument here, I hate both of them
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE ARENADO!!!!
noland you're breaking my heartdies
Glove was there, but fuck that throw
Is Arenado a secret puerto rican agent?
Might not of even fielded that bad hop
There's something happening here
Did you watch any of the other games?
Am I the only one who hates this chant
Still 3 innings, I haven't given up yet
Technically, it was just a shard
Yeah  But it will remain a mystery to us
Does Goldschmidt save that ball?
He knew he was out during the swing lol
Damn, you have the heart of a gerbil!
NOW he wants to bring in Goldy?
Something something prequel memes
hey fuck you Leyland, let Murphy play
So he's a blatant Puerto Rican agent!
Crawford hits lefties well, it's ok
This is a must win game, isn't it?
He came in when McCutchen got tossed
Claudio's delivery is so freaky
I believe there is one but it's a joke
Please give me a 3 run Stanton bomb
Why is Josh Harrison starting again?
Please get Stanton up with 2 on
Oh yeah  That's right  There is one
That's all sports fans in my experience
Did you watch the playoffs last year?
USA needs some odd year bullshit magic
Hey call rizzo and Bryant for 2021 yea?

Holy fuck, I almost had a cardiac arrest
Hulk Beltran almost hit one out!
Jose Valentinoh that's a familiar face
I'm happy but my Beltran PTSD is strong
Is this umpire in love with Molina?
robertson has been solid this tournament
I don't think he ever actually committed
Annnnnnnd I hate the homeplate ump again
Got him looking on another ball
But what did he do to the chili??
DO NOT DENY DONGCARLOFUCK OFF IS RIGHT
This ump really likes PR, Jesus
i really want trout to hit 500 500
Umpire bet on PR before the game
Can we get runs off Edwin Diaz?
More unplayable than No Man's Sky
And on any other count if you hit them
sure that wasn't a strike, ump?
Surprised that one wasn't a strike
Why'd you tell him to do that Yadi?
Where the fuck is Daniel Murphy?
Why wasn't that a strike ump!?!
Goldschmidt pinched hit for him
Can someone explain the tiebreaker?
And that Arenado made a bad throw
Get rid of umpires behind the plate
I think it's based on who they've beaten
We need more patriotic shitposting
I sure hope that isn't the only reason
Yeah, Edwin Diaz blow a three run save?
You've watched this game right?
I mean I do Just not for Team USA
Cmon Nolan 3 run blast  You owe us
How epic would a comeback be here though
Super epic and it'd be glorious!
Correct, PR plays NED with a win here
He does look like Scottie Pippen lmao
Daniel Richard Duffy Dude \shoves
If executed well, charcoal grey is dope
Here comes the homeplate umpire
Oh hey the umpire isn't a COMPLETE twat
HOLY FUCK the balls to take those balls
That had bleachers written all over it
CMON BOYS, WIN THIS FUCKING SHIT
Goldy is due like fuck, come on
Worst part is he had to swing at that
Bold move to have Goldy hitting
Come on Goldy, you beautiful man you
Well that takes away the DP at least
Surprised he didn't call that a strike
LETS GO CRAWDADDY YOU CAN DO IT
Fuck, I just realized it's the 9th
I want that 2014 WC game replay
Down to the wirebe the savior Crawford!
Yady looks like he's about to cry lol
Y'all need to give us more sugar!
Please, Crawford You're the last hope
Hit this shit into the Ozone, please
I believe you mean emotionally inspire
wow that CF'er dove a biiiiiit too early
pls tie it on another wild pitch
I'M SORRY FOR DOUBTING YOU CRAWDADDY
Oh shit I thought he got tagged at third
why tf would you go for a triple there?
Holy shit Crawford came through!
CRAWFORD YOU SEXY SON OF A BITCH!
JESSSUUUUUS This game THIS GAME
MVP CrawEdit Oh jeez, bad slide
nice to see paying the umps work out
The ump is either blind, or blind
Well now we can't bitch about the umps
THE REPLAY CANT SEE US IF WE STAY STILL
lol he was out by a mile at 3rd
Not even close really Botched call
Oh my God these umps He was SO out
Josh Harrison is the guy we have here?
Relay would have ended the game
And Murphy was safe earlier Tough shit
well shit that's very, very out
Looked kinda like Redfoo anyway
Our last hope is Josh Harrison, RIP
I just hate seeing Molina celebrate
lol this US team has to rely on Harrison
Why is Josh Harrison on the team
Goddamn it Harrison Fuck Leyland
WHY DIDN'T THEY GET SOMEONE GOOD TO HIT
WHAT THE FUCK IS JIM LEYLAND DOING
Justice ServedThanks baseball Gods
Sucks USA lost but love the PR passion
What the fuck is wrong with you
Honestly, why is he batting there
USA vs DR is going to be fuckin nuts
How do you let Harrison hit there?
If only Puerto Rico was our 51st state
um i think Murphy was taken out
So yea, nolans error is huge now
W-we'll get em tomorrow guys :(
I'll be watching tomorrow then!
\;implying those are different things
Every one of them this year, pretty much
Can someone explain stakes to me?
Baez found the camerawhat a surprise
Could have pinch hit That is a thing
Yeah but that contract isn't for the WBC
Baez didn't color his hair PHONY
How am I supposed to go to sleep now!?!
Especially not the last out of the game
He started, but was pinch hit for
maybe the ump knew he blew the call
Clearly Leyland is an anti-Semite  s
One bad throw fucks us over AGAIN
WE WILL NOT SETTLE FOR FIFTH PLACE!
Puerto Rico also has its own Soccer team
Surprised to see the Mets that low
i mean english isnt his first language
Senility is a sad thing to witness

Errors lead to runsGarbage start
Now don't paint the devil on the wall
‪Damn, Cano just turned on that ball!
The C is for Captain, also for Cano
How many ways can I proclaim FUCK OFF?
no because dominicans aren't a race
Yeah The contract made no sense at all
Not looking too hot there, 'Murica
So you know how you beat the Dominicans?
Come on US we expect better from you
it grazed his arm first  HBP  Not foul
You must have missed USA VS Colombia
US defense gonna show up or nah?
Duffy is getting no help at all
Five, that's two errors already
Time to get really really drunk
McCutchen slides safe into right field
Well At least we went to the moon
on pace for a 5 inning mercy rule
The American Dream can't be dead
Glad team USA started their ace
Should've been over like 2 times
Brandon Crawford Redemption Tour
IS BRANDON CRAWFORD A RUSSIAN HACKER?
He was safeEDIT: Never mind Great call
Yo bruh, he got a good look at it
That ump hesitated so fucking hard
I got a good look at itNah - Cruz
the double play was a better option imo
Better than his strike zone so far
I love how hot the onfield mics are
Shit throw saved by a terrible slide
Duffy:( I want him to do well so bad
Depends Have you won a Heisman?
TIL WBC games are only 1 inning long
And then come home again, again again
I am not ashamed to say I own that album
Duffy with a 5 out inning there
Alright I'll take 2 for the first
I think he would've had it Oh well
Aguilas fan here, did not like that one

He still looks cool when he messes up
that's the reyes i remember in toronto
He essentially threw a 5 out inning
Homerun right here for Cutch, calling it
That third base umpire means business
Duffy got like 5 outs last inning
Rocking back and forth on my chair
McCutchen has been McBUTTchen this WBC
Mccutchen has hit a ball before right?
Cutch has been so bad this tournament
Did cutch forget how to baseball?
How the mighty have fallen Cutch
About as far off as humanly possible
Edwin Jackson would like a word
Had to give ump a BJ on his birdie
I would laugh if we were winning
Do they have mics on the field?
in the spirit of national unity ;)
Seriously, the game feels so alive
that side was way too young to retire
Well, still waiting for that moment
what the fuck is this garbage ass music
Lol Goldy is a better base stealer too
A Long John Silvers commercial?
So Beauty and the Beast was legit
Did I miss something on that play?
Second the link, sounds awesome
Did I really need to mark it sarcasm?
Was it better than the animated version?
Eric Hosmer, solely to piss this sub off
Cutch for the redemption factor
Kozma was camped under the ball
Who are the alternatives right now?
IS THIS ANNOYING YOU, CAPS LOCK GUY?
Polanco for Refnyder who says no?

CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
Pirates because why would they do that
Put Posey in Lucroy can't call shit
Duffman pls stop getting lit up
How fucking awful can this damn team be
Even my eternal optimism is fading
This doesn't look good, fellow Yanks
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
You'd be implying it, not inferring it
Leyland why didn't you start Posey?
They're squaring up the Duffster
Is this how England feels in the WC?
Hell yeah He's got that clutch gene
Leyland alternating Lucroy and Posey
Is this how England feels during the WC?
Obama wiretapped our dugout phones
Holy shit, they may get out of this
Well, time for that bloop single

William Shatner's protege, no doubt
Kinsler is being real patient tonight
They compete separately in everything
Making up for his first AB big time
That's such a freaking dope gift
Yep, that's why he's on the roster!
I hate that woman who is like OH CHEVY!
Adam Jones is a wonderful human being
What ever happened to Tony Gwynn Jr
424 feet is when it stopped going up
He's on the Padres broadcast team now
He's the Padres radio analyst npw
Ask an employee to change to it?
and Hearthstone if I'm not mistaken

Happy 40th birthday, Fernando Rodney
They call him Bigfoot for a reason
So they are due to give up runs

Verlander is so played out, c'mon man
Tony Pena gets it from the best
Arenado wins just on patriotism alone
Ahhh 2007-2014 as a Mets fan 8')

They gotta be good at something, right?!
Sweet lord DR has some nasty closers
That looked very un2011 World Series
Oh now Cruz can run down a fly ball
Cruz has learned since last time ;)
As a Rangers fan, I had the same thought
So Neshek is who I'd be if I had money?
Hes actually been a pretty OFer for us
Robinson Cruz couldn't get that one
He's got a lot of little kid in him!
FUCK I LOVE ME SOME BRANDON CRAWFORD
Looks so much like Jake Gyllenhaal

Dellin with the Jordans and high socks
Clippard looks like Colin Cowherd
Baseball is boring - actual Rendon quote
Nelson Cano would have cut that off
This nerd is gonna ruin this game for us
Take Cutch out he is a butcher out there
Is Polanco dipping and if so WHY
Polanco now batting 1600 in the wbc
Polanco cannot be stopped holy shit
She had nice tits, I'm guessing?
Is it illegal in Cali or something?

Fall 2015 Clippard is back Fuck
Canó save that shit for the season pls
I miss watching Cano play for 162 games

Damn Nerherlands Get your shit together
dang, that was perfection from Javy
Great eye by the ump on that call
tears for fears legend curt smith
If that was Baez, he would have been out
He may have glanced his fingers
Javy needs to teach Lindor how to tag
Those Braves teams had great chemistry
You're just talking in the WBC, right?
Not true, though bruises are hematomas
perfect And from Smoltz, of all people
He'd safe, but great play by Baez
Are you like 20 minutes behind?
Yea have you seen that happen ever
Yea gimme more yankee highlights
Yeah I hate getting calls right too
What if your just 20 minutes ahead?
Ah, now I understand Will Little  s
He looks like an uncle out there
Cubs uniforms need more sequins
Uhhh how about Roberto Clemente?
naw, i was about 5'10 at the time
why does anyone throw Baez a strike ever
That's what the amphetamines are for
Same, and it's 3:45AM here in Holland
Almost tacked him off the base lol
So are you drinking like 3 Red Bulls?
Profar wanting that revenge lol
WTF YADI WAS SAFE WHERE'S THE REVIEW
we gonna be brawling by the 7th
There are reviews in the final round
Angry Javy is a pretty good Javy
Ok Baez calm down, they'll review it lol
Holy shit, this man is a wizard
Javy is really damn good at baseball
the latest angle is a pretyt clear safe
Manfred would like word with you
Baez is just so crafty It's nuts
That's the greatest slide I've ever seen
xander should have made a better tag
That makes up for the Molina call
Did they bleep out his curse word?
Shhhh just let me have my moment
Fucking magic Baez man I love it
That's a good one Definitely close
blows kisses at tv screen Luv u Javy
Holy shit, this guy does look like A-Rod
looks like your opinion was wrong
Why do they swing at shite pitches?
Can't believe they got out of that
been a while since you could say that
J A V Y        A      V       Y
I'd trust Baez with any kind of slide
Except the horse didn't deserve that :(
Another Javy montage yes please
and next year with the bat as well
When is Balentine a free agent?
Big Daddy almost went yard again haha
Wladimir Balentien or Barry Bonds?
Holy shit, Balentien Fucker is strong
So someone should sign Balanteine
age is just a number -adrian beltre
Maybe he just likes Japan Matty
Oh no IBB, time to turn off the TV
Who's complaining about the Dutch?
ha, ironically now I'm not sure I did!
Is Jair Jurjjens still in the league?
Not to the same degree, but yes
HOLY MOSES THIS GAME IS BANANAS
Under This tournament will be the reason
Wait wasn't he blocking the plate
I'm sick of those shitty slides
Baez and Molina is so wrong, it's right
jesus christ, that relay is pornographic
Man this game is fuckin awesome so far
Take some sliding classes from Baez pls
intentional walk thrownManfred dies
Hnnnggg, that throw from my Baez
I wish my cities schools had horses
Still a brighter future than the Orioles

Buck is spilling buckets right now
I fucking love baseball soooo damn much
Hey, it's that one Rooster Teeth guy
see Puerto Rico pls save our economy
The western half would be ok though :D
is yadier molina a fucking god or what
Perfectly executed by all 3 players
Someone listens to Effectively Wild
each at bat would take 30 minutes easily
Who was comparing them to those two?
That's NLCS MVP Javier Baez to you
That doesn't seem that technical
NOyou stay in the dugout oh my god
I'm hearing it's the Best Vacation Ever
Correa inside the park HR right here
JURJJENS IS SO FUCKING SLOW MAN
Whose the asshole downvoting everyone?
Ah, and there's the pickoff attempts too
Especially without the Giants uniform
Is Jansen available to pitch tonight?
No, Puerto Rico doesn't say Rich Port
One can sleep when they're dead
Yes, but probably only for 15-20 pitches
My signal cut out wtf happened?
Christopher Russo - Master Juggler
I want to sleep but I want more baseball
Oh hey, ANOTHER PITCHING CHANGE
C'mon Beltran, DH with your bad self
pretty sad like super sad almost
Does a 7 inning no hitter count though?
He was supposed to be the next big thing
This is a bizarre world we live in
Is Beltran's beard white or died blond?
Looks like it Either him or an imposter
Baseball can only handle so many Js
Is Beltran's beard white or died blond?
Don't draw the devil on the wall
Challenge that routine fly ball, Coach
The two aren't mutually exclusive
the whole team dyed their pubes as well
Is it really only the 5th inning?
Yes It was called Jair Jurjjens
I'm no expert but I think that's a lot
Netherlands could actually pull this off
The reviews are really killing it
down goes the dominicanpretty epic call
Eh, there's videos to strip them
The 1 was only 43 AB for the year though
sine me up for more of this game
He's trying to psych the pitcher out
Whatever  you do don't strike out
This game is making NFL games look short
Zone is wonky or it's the camera
Wait til you see the 2-strike strikeouts
Broadcast guide says 9pm-12am LOL
Larry King not at the game tonight :-(
Why isn't the Royal's blue Royal blue
The last three words saved this
like a reverse CFP championship
We won the last World Cup in Baseball
He looks a dead ringer for Dale Jr there
Didn't they miss the Euros last year?
1 You're out 2 You're not out Live ball
A piece of HVAC tubing isn't music

Hopefully it never becomes incorporated
Schoop just wants to grab some ass
LAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGA -Jonathan Schoop
Gungo, hublot, Nippon express, Nomura

Leake must be god awful then  s

I wish, I have work from 4pm-3am :(
LAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAYou tell me
One time I met James Van Der Beek
Yeah, they can't stop complaining
How else would you evaluate his value?
they are standard at doyer games
More baseball is never un-American
Ben Thijssen to answer your question
The most 80's music video of all time
Where do New Holland tractors' rank?
Greg would be 1 a year or two ago
RIP The good ones always go too early

Except for those 12pm east coast games
I swear that was the longest inning
That is just beyond outstanding
OH SHIT PR ABOUT TO GET STUIFBERGENED
okay PR light this guy staleburger up
Wow pitcher really missed his spot
So Japan doesn't test for Roids?
It's like getting Bergened but worse
holy crap clemente was only 38???
Game winning triple make it happen!
Where are you getting Dairy Queen?
No but they are experts in bird law
Nothing if he doesn't answer his phone
He better stay away from the Nats
They didn't pay for every inning
Andrelton Simmons almost made the play
Holy fuck simmons can make mistakes?
Forced retirement or Mexican League ?
Random statcast on Lindor there
Did that on purpose just to trick you
Japan by far Their hats suck though
Is there Dutch version of Craig Kimbrel?
Same, with extra hep c on the side
Don't need him They got Stuiffy
I don't like where this is going
Don't forget our 7 foot closer :)
I got a Stuiffy watching him pitch
; couple ~~outs~~ mound visitsFTFY
Just in time for this game to be over
You learn to tune them out after a while
I like the little Claudio glove wiggle
We don't have a choice We tolerate them
Dope I hope you can make it out!
Time to put on the rally clogs!
Had anybody checked on Manfred recently?
First mistake was taking a class at 8am
SOMEBODY CALL A DOCTOR I'M FUCKING DYING
MLBtv + Adblock Plus= no commerceials

Hingle McCringleberry, Penn State
Absolutely embarrassing from Profar :
Because Imperialism is wierd like that
How is baseball in the Netherlands?
KIKEEEEEEEEEGet those bananas out!
Your teams televise baseball games?
good luck getting drunk with bud light
ESPN Radio is apparently broadcasting
IF YOU CANT BUNT THEN DONT BUNT
Hoping for an all American final
A Javy bomb would be nice right now
Why are they yellow to begin with?
Jansen has to be warming up at least
Is it true that the AL rarely bunts?
Somewhere, Manfred is anxiously waiting
He's tricking Baez into going oppo
MLB Statcast just went full mast
He grounds into a ton of double plays
Chop that shit off and let's go
Can't hit a triple if you hurt your feet
Oh fuck, I hope Balentien is OK!
My mistake, thank you for catching that
BAEZ LITERALLY KILLING NETHERLANDS
THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE US OUT!
Giants trainer looks like Ricky Gervais
; Steel tipped ~~boots~~ clogsFTFY
Baez is giving it to the Netherlands
that catcher must have a concussion
Can we get an AMA with the organ player?
Better bring out a yellow card soon!
Only 1 inning, period?Screw the Dodgers
If only little Marco was Puerto Rican
Tom Stuifbergen: High leverage reliever
Baez cannot stay off that down and away
the Dutch did their homework, damn
Its okay, its only an hour past bed time
To the 9th we go in a tie game!
This game is totally going to the 11th
outside and in the dirt never fails
That bunt might have cost the game
I want extras because team chaos
I'm just saying it because dodgers
To get a runner into scoring position
Is not gonna miss regular season games
Matty needs one of those Wahl shavers
This is how genocides are started
He went to college here I think
I believe he'll be good for Opening Day
Right down the middletop left corner
Lol check swing on the 2-0 fastball
Get The Bat Into Balentien's Hands
TURN THAT FUCKING DOUBLE BOYS!!
AAAANNNDDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
You just made my week Thank you!
HOW IS YOUR HEART MINE IS STILL RACING
Have yourself a game, Javy Baez!
That did not went as i had hoped
This game has had more double plays than
This game is sloppy but incredible
I just want a walk off by this point
Lets all celebrate with a slice
Don't think so, can't really tell
Ballentien walked it off earlier
And that's bullshit and boils my blood
What a weird pitch this guy throws
Almost sunrise on the east coast
Nasty cutter, nasty cutter, nasty cutter
pfft, it's not even tomorrow yet
Why does Matty V say Santa Maria?
7 minutes  Fak  I need to go to bed
most dominant closer at the wbc
Dude's gonna pitch an immaculate inning
GoddamnYou could've had this man, Nats
Kenley is just mowing down these scrubs
Back at it again with that nasty cutter
No immaculate inning for Jansen :p
Curacao baseball independence when?
Jansen is allergic to ~~triangles~~ hits
What a great inning by Jansen Goddamn
Still have mad respect for thole
EXTRA INNINGS HERE WE FUCKING GO
Big fan of Alberto Kawasaki, myself
Please don't go to the 11th inning
This is why I hate west coast games
Pagan no longer a giant so you good
I Will Fucking Cry No Bamboozles
Good afternoon  Good evening  Good night
7 9 Can't even throw 9 strikes DFA
Did he say Diaz is on the Rangers?
schoop gonna hit a 2-run shot laterwatch
Prepare yourself for a bad look
Watching a WC exit sure is enjoyable
So when is Van Persie gonna pinch hit?
ooooh we got some extra inning beef!
Half an inning from softball rules
Dutch guys were hot What changed
Dutch guys were hot - Matt Vasgersian
This sequel to the 2013 fight sucks
Love you Baez, but stop instigating
Balentien boutta go yard after that
Extra Innings getting a bit interesting!
Molina doing some good peacekeeping
Can we stay away from the head please?
It makes sense if you think about it
I was certain there was gonna be a brawl
I LOVE BASEBALL THAT WAS FUCKING SICK
A brawl is all this game is missing
Honestly, Baez is kind of annoying
He can suprman-headbutt a home run
Never forget the brawl to end all brawls
Baez is such a ticking time bomb haha
The Diaz gospel being spread &lt;3
What is happening please send  h elp
That 99 mph dart on the corner tho
He's got the neck tattoos for it
; You gotta love the guyEh I disagree
Why does he even throw off speed?
HOLY SHIT DIAZ THAT WAS SO FUCKING NASTY
3 runs 11 hits 0 errors Each Holy shit
DIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZ
looks at your flair, is confused
TELL ME NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE WBC
Hahahahaha unreal WBC is so legit
THIS GAME JUST TURNED UP A NOTCH !!!
You thought you were going to sleep?
God I love watching him already
i think he was mad about how high it was
THIS IS THE TRUE WORLD BASEBALL
Now THAT is a Dutch as fuck name
Bigger they are, harder they fall
Fucking Paul Bunyan on the mound
Van Mil center for the Chicago Bulls
I think Puerto Rico walks it off here
Holy shit this guy looks out of place
Taking out Jansen is how PR wins
Let's just hope he throws strikes
Pls score now, no 11th inning bull shit
Probably my favorite baseball quote
Has a game gone to the 11th so far?
He'd hit the catcher in the face
Why isn't Babe the Blue Ox catching?
Nasty I love watching this guy throw
Yeah, Japan Netherlands in pool E
waves hand over head vigorously
If you ain't Dutch, you ain't much!
Japan vs Netherlands and DR vs Colombia
The fucking Catalina Wine Mixer

Contractually, not physically, spent
and corkscrew himself into the ground

We are quite good at it actually :)
Team Chaos, 10 more innings pls
Gregerson, Diaz, Melancon, Familia
The Sandman  has been denied (Cackles)
Rafael van der Vaart is my vote
For real I don't wanna see that
Ummmhis lanky ass must have heard you
RIP fun game Was nice knowing you
Ghost runners to decide global supremacy
MLBTV Doc Emerick-level announcing
Last out I think Not totally sure tho
Can't be too long if it's never played
Seems like Puerto Rico wants to lose
I thought it was called blernsball
Ah that makes sense (relatively)
The mensch on the bench is unhappy
This 11th inning rule is such bullshit
Wasn't this a rule pre-Manfred?
Dumb extra innings rules are dumb
This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen
Jaaaaa stijn lekker bezig jongen
Whoa can't see the results before voting
Bunt from a random Dutch dude!!
3 on 3 OT is finefuck shootouts tho
When do they switch to 3-on-3 action?
Every game will be like thisBuntIBB??
These commentators are a disgrace
Haha of course we love this rule too
This rule has nothing to do with Manfred
Is that the Harry Potter theme?
Start with the bases loaded????
Loving the Harry Potter theme right now
Is that Harry Potter on the organ?
THAT WAS FUCKING A  LIT ASS DOUBLE PLAY
AAAANNNDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
God damn it my fucking stream is behind

Fuck vasgersian and fuck this rule
Congrats on the win Puerto Rico
Diaz has fucking nerves of steel
Well what happened to the profit?
baez about to win MVP this yearbaby!
He played the Zelda theme earlier haha
HOLY SHIET THEY GOT OUT UNSCATHED!
If this goes to the 12th, same rules?
This is worse than NFL overtime
you could have that any time in extras
‪Bold strategy that paid off!
So will Yadi or Javy walk it off?
Who the hell said bring back buck
Kind of want The Netherlands to win
Can you pinch run the lead guy?
I need a santa maria this inning pls
yadi Fundamentally Sound Molina
Only needing 1 run is why you bunt here
This game was so goodWhat a disaster
probably pulled up a YouTube video
I wasn't even excited over that
The downside of Profar in center :(
meh  I like that PR won, but meh
No way man, bunts can be sexy too
It's over and I just feel disappointed
What a ridiculous way to end this game
TOOTBLANS cost the Dutch the game
Bunt and a fly ball shouldn't win a game
Just how we all knew it would end  s
Great job, PR You deserved a better win
Fuck your gayass extra innings rules
dramatic fashion literally set up to win
Extra inning rule= Buzz Killington
Great game ruined by a terrible rule
~~baseball~~International baseball  FTFY
The most boring fucking ending ever
Walking off without a hit It's stupid
The extra innings rule is trash
Happy PR won but such a stupid ending
‪Congratulations to Puerto Rico!
Great game, super anti-climactic ending
definitely not a fan of that rule
What a fucking lame ass way to go
It is what it is, i guessshrugs
CELEBRATORY SWEARING IN SPANISH
Dammit, stupid 11th inning rule
Great game ruined by a terrible rule
Fuck that stupid rule Ruined the game
Ya got any more of those double plays
Oh god, he's speaking more Spanish
Well that was anticlimactic but I mean
¡PUERTO RICO PUÑETA VAMOS BORICUA!
losnuestros este año si vamos a ganar!
Look at the bucket of caramel popcorn
Exactly, that ending was barely exciting
Crying Jordan meme calling u jdhill1188
Japanese reporter getting soaked
I wanted PR to win but that still sucked
A bunt and a fly out, not even a hit
Was that 3 or 4 double ups for Javy?!
This is funny but god damn is he a tool
Olay olay olayyyyy olay olayyyyy
Yikes, poor Balentien got made a fool
Puñeta, which is basically fuck yeah
Man, I sure do hate the Cubs bitter

The runs aren't considered his?
TOOTBLANsTOOTBLANs everywherefade me fam

They lost on a bogus penalty kick rule
Are you from Europeor Caribbean?
No me toco = He didn't touch(tag) me
Yadier Molina is a god among men
i'm 5'10i eat Ok pats my belly haha :D
Superman - from the show Scrubs
But how about the fans community?
Gonna be a lot of overthrows though
You're clearly not familiar with Brisbee
You must not have been very old in 2000
If I'm a closer, the sopranos intro song
Yea he looks out to me Just barely
So, you have to actually tag the player?
Also what does he think he did?
because he plays for the netherlands?
Thank you for all of your help!
That pitch was, at best, at the letters
The Michael Phelps of the base paths
Easily worth it if you're out of market
Where did Profar think he was??
Yadi is an absolute savage and I love it
Nolan Arenadosorry i was too ambiguous
That type of showboating after a single?
Savage, get your head in the game!
Who did you think would be above him?
Seattle Mariners Don't be a Mariners fan
Everybody knows your name - Cheers
He flies out to right in the next pitch
They need to teach to tag em in the face
Plot twist: Driver is playing CF
You leave our AL Central homie alone!
The Rays I'm from Saint Petersburg
I completely forgot about that rule
they dont usually play in march though
Solution to a non-existent problem

I like the close up shots on players
therethere was a host before Sajak?
Dutch absolutely screwed themselves
r TodayIBullshitted would like a word
de Jong would like a word about that
What is this feeling I feel happy
Glad to see Eminem found another hobby
Pretty good for our 6 7th starter
more necessary than using your closer
SpongeBob theme ARE YOU READY KIDS?
Laces don't count when applying a tag
The OT example makes sense to me
hes not that good strikes out a TON
They're our division's punching bag
Im guessing its harder than that
Just wait til they play Rome in April
No wonder he was so bad at soccer
what sport did he play instead?
Jose Quintana's Colombia jersey?
by bowing out gracefully to the US
Fuck, that last pitch was paint
Tell my kids we went out swinging
That's the remnants of Gawker for you
just above the ankles to your Hairline?
Now THIS is EXCITEMENT, gentlemen!
Did anyone actually think he was safe??
That never occurred to me Good point
Looks like someone got away with one
I was asking you who the showboaters are

I meant to type Rizzo, not Votto
There's no way to tell from this angle
What's the point of these contracts?
I love that half-hearted attempt Strike?
lol I imagined the meme right away
You must not talk to Royals fans often
We just can't trade him  Just can't!
There's already too many of those
Must've been a public golf course
Shoutout to my boy Zach Borenstein!!
Maybe Dylan Cease or Chesney Young?
McCovey Cove will fill right up again
I agree other than the safe part!

Bo Bichette and Sean Reid foley
Everyone knows about Rutherford
Still raw after blowing that 3-1 lead?
u slappy012 not Bugs Bunny confirmed
USA game tonight will be different
Well ya but we all hate the braves
He's a fine bench player prospect
In the same vein, Jose Albertos
Yeah thats where the tag - you're it!
Yes, then there's that abomination
Make pitchers throw less pitches?
He was out  It was a bad overturn
Hopefully He's had struggles in the past
And they have to watch baserunners
Guarantee you he could crack 300 OBP
Probably because of the eyebrows
It might be something to do with cricket
Do you work in the front office?
More importantly, not with that talent
Basabe is a meaningful piece too
What does that have to do with Israel?
People give Headley way too much shit
My pordigal proginagel my son returns
Any particular reason he's your boy?
Well it was a pretty shit joke tbh
I will stick with Red Sox vs Cubs
Also for being the son of Phil Simms
Well, well, well How the turntables
Good, that is where Bonds should be
Were dead on the inside, leave us alone
Maybe if he got on base like Barry Bonds
Pros don't use those Bad for the knees
He's actually hitting decently Go figure
I thought Subway got rid of Jared?
It's ok bro I still think it's 2014

Not everyone here is circumsised
harper looks ON this spring Im excited
Problem being he wasn't on enough :(
Knee savers r for little bitches tho
that would be Lonzo Ball Oh wait
he can still hit 20 home runs i bet
I'm 100% for more of that in MLB
A lot of AL East fans hating here
ya but he plays for the nationals
Mayoketchup:  Mayo, Ketchup, garlic
He did not miss his chance to throw
Good luck Chad Fuck yourself cancer
Zach Britton ain't no Mariano Rivera
He's Dominican, not African American

He can replace David Wright if he wants
I doubt it, since it's run by the MLB
Thank you Bee memes Good lord spare me

Melancon admires the works of Karl Marx
What's an out and how do you count?
Alright Melancon, let's do this
Just getting the double play in order
They think it is the top of the 9th?
so he can give up hits super early  s :(
Great song and a solid remix of it
I swear to christ everyone, don't say it
The drum reminds me of Jacobs Field
Someone flipped to the wrong camera lol
fundamentals cultural differences
Melancon is indifferent about America!
There were two languages last night
IS THAT SOME ZELDA MUSIC UP IN HERE?
Always nice to hear the Zelda theme
Did Melancon just pitch towards the bat?
these jazz guys just dont stahp
The organist just played the Zelda theme
hahah the video game music is great
what kind of stuff does melancon have?
I want to buy the organist a beer or 7
It's next level you wouldn't understand
Zelda theme while Japan bats Love it
And now the horns picked up Zelda

Whoa, player-manager on Team Japan?
I'm just saying 2016 is fresh in my mind
Goddamn that excites me I'm so glad!

Whatever makes it more entertaining
Get your shit together Melancon

Clear the benches like last night
It was Back to the Future earlier
Lol that's almost over the plate dude
christ Aoki is on top of the plate
Lmao Japan bringing flopping to baseball
His front foot was ON the plate
That pitch was over the plate, just high
Why is he standing in the strike zone
Watching Aoki fall down is hilarious
dude's practically standing on the plate
I'd take Pedroia over Murphy, imo
Melancon lookin to get roundhoused
god those pitches have been wild
I'm not adverse to walking Aoki here
Why don't they clean the plate?
4 pitch walk to get to the power hitter?
Shit Who else we got in the pen?
I mean with his stance it basically is
maybe make them clean home plate?
I said oh lord jesus it's a fire
Why bring in neshek to face a lefty?

These review rules are horrible
oh shit he's out Hand comes off
No question with that last angle
But the regular season is so close!
Nolan Arenado at every position
Hosmer looks like he has good manners
Too close to overturn, good call
nah we're going 15 innings in this bitch
thank mr new york replay office
Zack Collins should change that
Dang really I thought he was out
☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜) back atcha buddy
Please let me have that monster dong
But like 3 of those were as Mike Stanton
Who's playing the halftime show?

But instead all we got was Apollo 1
Now do it like the Superman logo
Stanton looks the same as last year
DITKA BEARS BEARS BEARS DITKA DITKA
Paying off gambling debts, gotta be
Time to build a wall around Wisconsin
Are they just as cringey and fake?
Pardon me, are you Mr Hosmer, sir?
No memes this commercial break?
Why is imposter Marlin man still there?

The bitch don't know about Pangea?
Do you like the smell of your own facts?
Is crime that bad in Puerto Rico?
Can Buster Posey legally play 1st?

I love you Javy but get out please Kthx
Great slide but he is still out there
TIL Twitter was not racist til 2013
Don't act like you don't know me!
Man a Baez strikeout what a shock
Did he have a number when he pitched?
Wasn't aware how, think I got it
Just a little strut from stroman
what, you've never seen Love Actually?
No no That dude CREATED budwiser
He's off playing Rocket League for a bit
Even though it's factually incorrect
Come on Sami Zayn do something good!
That just makes more questions!
No, he went to America for Betty Draper
GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
lol pretty much latino baltimore
Park is looking pretty damn full tonight
GOD, I'M SO HAPPY THE RANGERS SIGNED YOU
Top 10 Anime Deathsi cri evrytim
Lugo spins me right round right round
TAKE THAT YOU FAKE PUERTO RICAN
He hit that one out the right way
KINSLER STOICALLY JOGGING THE BASES

HOOOOMMMMEEEEEE RUUUUUUUUNNNNNN
Oh god twitter is gonna shit itself
So are we allowed to celebrate or
Oh ok Rocket league is always worth it
I mean, USA wins either way right?
Good, our first catch of the day
CALLING BACK TO BACK RIGHT MEOW!!
IAN DOING HIS JOB THE RIGHT FUCKING WAY
Now that's how you show emotion boys!
Which by any metric is an improvement
You can't spell American without Ian
Rangers old and new getting it done!
Isn't this game really just USA vs USA?
I feel dirty saying this butU-S-A!!
At work, is this on espn radio?
Kinsler deserves a gold star for that
ESPN 2 and MLB Network sharing cameras?
Youre not Captain America Jones, Kike
Can we turn off the goddamn music?
Manfred no hablando Español :-O
LUGO GAVE UP A NON-SOLO HOME RUN!
; Adam Jones walksWHAT EVEN IS THIS
JONES JUST WALKED APOCALYPSE IS NIGH
You're still kind of a dick Ian
I am ok with the current situation
Looks like Lugo should've stayed sick
I see the winds of change a happenin
I never claimed they were now did I?
I was gonna say that sounded off to me
Why is the radio feed not in mlb at bat?
Not quite my name, but close enough :P
Was that Mario into a let's go chant?
Read the I as a lowercase L CI is RBI
Baseball euphemisms are so fucking weird
Stupid sexy Yadi and his framing
WHAT?!?!?!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
HOW ABOUT WE DONT STRIKE OUT ARENADO
this game has me all kinds of confused
Yelich looked like he had some PTSD
Get ready for another strike out
Wake up Nolan pls the world is watching
Lmaooo @ that being called a strike
whew lad the umps are going at it again!
He's about to strike out again isn't he
karma for trying to frame that garbage
Arenado is painful to watch right now
Annnnd Arenado just struck out again
Yikes I really think they broke him
Alright Leyland It's time to bench him
Arenado plz take the sombrero off
Will Arrenado ever make contact again?
Who decided to bat the pitcher cleanup?
Is that 6 straight Ks from Arenado?
arenado only good cause of coors??
Remind me again why Arenado is batting?
And certainly not 8 times Never!
i didn't know they made 6K TV's
Eek, Arenado just looks all messed up
that sure is some Prime stat cast
to be fair, it is my parents' couch
I genuinely feel bad for Arenado now
You gotta bench Arenado after that swing
;As senile as Leyland isFTFY, mlb
I think of it as a Platinum Sombrero
Would love to see Bregman at 3rd
It would be 3-0 if Bregman were playing
Can Arenado see the baseball at all?
i will forever upvote this meme
Checks his pulse, yup, still alive
Goldy homers on that intentional walk
ahBill Shaikin tweeted it was 6
I thought of that just as I posted it
Im ready for Cutch to open this game up
Doesn't have Coors to help him  s
Fuck that, put in Bregman He's earned it
Platinum sombrero is 5 Ks in one game
Seriously, why isn't he at the game?
Oh no did Cutch catch the Arenado?
Cutch doing his best Arenado impression
God damn that was a long inning
he needs to research from tip to tip
that was the stadium announcer said
Let's not get carried away here
What happened to good McCutchen?
I hope Lugo can give 2 more innings
He donated them to charity IIRC
then how do you explain kinsler?
Yeah but before that, he put it in play!
He shouldn't be batting cleanup
What a shitty cover of a great song
Could he have played for Cuba though?
The English broadcast is on MLB Network
Nah at least Cutch made contact
NPB season is only 143 games now
English is on MLBN ESPN has spanish
Will Kiké ever change his nickname
I'll even take the unknown of Bregman
if it wasn't on a wednesday night
I honestly thought Stroman was Canadian
lol what a nerd going to college
Yes Don't tell Leyland about Kinsler
His music career isn't very good
He was asked about it specifically
Fuck yeah - every fuckin' day Ian
29 pitches to get 8 outs for Stroman
they cant hurt you anymore buddy
That just means he's not a Blue Jays fan
dodger stadium has 20,000 more seats!
Why can't Lucroy catch the ball
dear god that's not even an exaggeration
Way too much emotion in that high five
Lucroy keeps dropping everything
its the facial hair, not a good look IMO
Screw South Carolina!-A Clemson Grad
The only duke guy ill cheer for lol
What does everyone think of More Life
Matty V with the early jinx there
STROMANS THROWING A COMPLETE GAME SHUTTY
Can we wait until it's over to fix it?
Yeah At least its fair how bad he is?
Did you know Steven Matz is from there?
Did I just hear a bit from Hamilton?
Wait, what were they talking about?
IT MUST BE NICE IT MUST BE NICE
quaker oats guy was a founding father
Connor McDavid with a beautiful goal!!
Topical at the very least Don't be naive
It's not like anyone is on base
I'll thank you right now: thank you!
Do some shit instead of asking Reddit
I think I'd put my money on Stroman
Did a feature with a friend who raps
The white one or the black one?
We got a downvoter UPVOTE PARTYYY!!!
Washington On Your Side from Hamilton
So when does this game get dank?
F) all of them at the same time
Classic pasta, not the right time
they're broadcasting the Deportes team
Washington On Your Side from Hamilton
Thanks Just changed to MLB Network
If we win this game he is ours!
Omg I literally just finished a pint
It'll be possible with the new IBB rules
alienation of labor, means of production
17 of the last 28 outs have been K's
Ball almost popped out of Rosarios glove
Who's this Bergman you speak of?
Puertoriceños: AMERICANOS TAMBIEN
Waft of tanned leather in there too?
THEY SHOWED HIS TWO HOMERUNS FROM TODAY

Right he was in Queens for2-3 seasons
M E T AINSTANT METABABY'S FIRST META
AM I BEING ~~DETAINED~~ ENTERTAINED?
This is starting to look like something
;probably calls soccer officials umpires
Stroman out there just dominating
So fucking easy, that was great
WHAT ARE THEY SELLING?CHOCOLATES?
Why are they jerking off Leyland so much
Stroman usually pause in his windup?
He's ok, he does this all the time
Stroman's fucking dealing right now
stroman is the best pitcher of all time!
Wow Stroman is mowing them down
THE STRO SHOW IS DEALING!!!!!!!!!!
MLB Network's music is on point tonight
Changed his grip mid-motion, wtf
STROOOO puttin on a top notch show
Stroman's such a beast when he's on
What a half inning for Stroman!
Word that was my first thought too
He's not a Stroman he's a Strooooo, man!
Marcus Stroman confirmed Japanese
I knew it was Grant, he's the best
That banjo part still haunts my dreams
I know I expected more out of Arenado
Taking predictions for Arenados next AB:
Better than the air bat Arenado is using
Strike out in two pitches He'll do it
Doesn't look like anything to me
The music has been awesome tonight
T H E R I G H T W A YHERIGHTWAY
Puzzle and Dragons ads, hilarious
kinsler be puttin up numbers boi
Ian Consummate Professional Kinsler
Kinsler wanted that ball, so he took it
I just really really like Maddux lol
His dad's a prison warden?I'm intrigued
Stro dominatingKinsler 2-run shot
Dueling Puerto Rico and USA chants omg
Where is the Brovloski thing from?
This chant has me feeling things
YOU'RE A LOOSE CANNON BOBROVSKI
Especially in the US, super weird
Thanks for the clarification, fella
Real American heroes draw walks
A 2nd walk for Jones, atta boy Cap'n!
LMAO I totally forgot about that movie
And Slim Shady is still in somehow?
Hope y'all ready for that MVP season
we are all usa on this blessed day
Lugo looks like Eminem from that angle
I think it's time for a yeli dong
Better score now before Arenado gets up
That's almost lower than I was expecting
What're they supposed to chant?
jesus this curve ball is fucking nasty
Will Arenado strike once again?
I don't think I could handle that
I love that the chants are alternating
Puerto Rico, USA is actually correct
Come Yelich do it for your MILF of a mom
is buzzword not a buzzword itself?
Holy shit he got a RBI Let's go
FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA MOTHERFUCKERS
Winner of this one game wins the WBC
TAKE THAT YOU FAKE PUERTO RICAN PT II
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
That was a casual jog to home by Ian
This is the winner take all game
WTF are you not doing at 3rd, Jonesy
YEAH LETS KEEP THE RUNS COMING IN
S P I N    P     I    I     P    N I P S
Don't wanna show up the other team
OKAY ARENADO TRY NOT TO STRIKE OUT AGAIN
Winner of this game wins the tournament
Tonight, he is everyone's boy!!
Let's blow this game up team USA!
Listen to that crowd Yelich so loud
Mets fans hate him for a reason
Freedom doesn't knock IT RINGS!
YOU'RE A LOOSE CANON BOBROVSKY!
how the hell did jones not score?
Please please please please please Nolan
The rally killer steps into the box now
Back to the Bobrovsky bit I see
And completely redeems himself!
Been waiting all night for these lol
What's baseball's version ofBOBROVSKY!!
You're off the force bobrovsky!
Yes, but can they spin a baseball?
Arenado can't even bunt right lol
Arenado can't even sac bunt smh
hey at least arenado made contact
Arenado still managed to fuck it up
Arenado can't even execute the bunt
He did a thing But not a good thing
Wow Arenado is really fucked up
Nolan can't do anything right lol
Oh look Nolan didn't strike out
AT LEAST IT WASN'T A STRIKEOUT, RIGHT?
holy shit jones running in quicksand
I know he's that cold buta bunt?
Snake bit at the moment it seems
Arenado was a bad cleanup choice
But it wasn't productive at all
That's a ground rule double at Coors
No he didn't, they got the lead runner
Just about any home run call I'd think
That bunt is fucking gone at Coors
Holy shit, put Nolan on the bench
One way to avoid another golden sombrero
Let's see how Nolan does baserunning
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT, BOBROVSKY
That did more harm than good lol
Does Alex Bregman actually exist
Well of course not he's a Slugger
I'm counting that as another K screw it
glad to see he remembered where it was!
TURN IN YOUR BADGE AND GUN BOBROVSKY
not watching the aclee steam are you?
Why does Nolan Arenado hate America?
What in the actual fuck is happening??
There are other Sunflower seed brands?
As you can see, I think about it a lot
Baez with that pornstar mascara
The Nolan Arenado Memorial Wooden Spoon
Obscure Boogie Nights reference, NICE!
Andrew almost assassinates George
Still an amazing play by Lindor
Don't let there be a 3-1 difference
holy shit i can't believe he got to that
ANDREW MCCLUTCHEN COMES THROUGH AGAIN
Damn Great effort by Lindor though
Impeccable effort from Lindor, wow
Wow, still a hell of a play by Lindor
MCCLUTCHEN YOU DESERVE A BIG MAC
And that was a beautiful play too
The WBC is Christian's coming out party
That was one helluva stop by Lindor
I'll take the run, good play by lindor
Lindor is unbelievable BUT YAY!
Holy crap Lindor You are too good
Regardless, that was a nice stop Damn
Buster is out by 30 feet on that play
I completely agreed when it happened
holy crap, that play by lindor tho
What's that the US is cooking?!!!
Yeah, that's some insane range there
only Jeter could have made that play  s
i'm almost mad he didn't get the out
I wish he could have finished that play
Is Marlins Man ever not on his phone?
Lindor pls be careful with that arm
Crawdaddy needs more grease baby!
teamchoke losnuestros forever2ndplace
I'm from PR and even I don't get it lol
I like what's happening this year
I don't know if that's possible
I'm ready for commercial break!
EVEN BAEZ'S EYE PAINT IS DOUCHEY
McCutchen needs to grow his hair back
So what's the pitch count limit again?
When will he play America, fuck yea?
That's if he makes it to the next WBC
At least it's not 3-1, 4-1, or 28-3
Then what in the world is a shreve?
They're getting a nice, blueish hue
I think  most of us are in there too
You couldn't pay me to see that movie
Only English broadcast is on MLB TV
He looks like Gil Grissom from CSI to me
nah 3-1 can't happen so we still good
MLBN has the English language rights
pretty sure it was King George III
These 3-1 lead comments are PAINFUL, fam
Crawford now has to play 3rd for Arenado
I have white crime completely memorized
Don't compare the Warriors to this team
Dear god  u aclee_ is Matt Vasgersian!
DAE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT INNING
Second time this game that's happened
Godamit Beltran move your fat ass
Jesus Christ, it's Matt Vasgersian
keep slicin' and dicin', Stroman
Wow okay fuck you too then buddy
Crawford's glove is fucking great
Yea but kershaw cant pitch in big games
Why are you the way that you are?
HE'S ACTUALLY PLAYING FOR ARENADO
Brandon Crawford is the infield
Just ask Toronto fans what 4-1 is
Three batters, three weak grounders Nice
well the puerto rican team sure didn't
GET OUT OF HERE, PUERTO RICO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crawford says he'll do it himself
Stroman continues to fuckin' DEAL!
ALL CRAWFORD ALL THE TIME OPEN 24 7
Crawford is all bat and no glove
Don't even need all nine on the field
Crawford on fucking point tonight
Crawford WBC Gold Glove winner!
Brandon Michael Crawford  Enough said
Keep hitting to Crawford, that's fine
That pitch count after 5 Oh baby
Feels sooo weird to cheer for Crawford
STOP SOUNDING SO CONFIDENT MATTY V!
That's the best burrito I've ever had
We found the market inefficency boys
After this next inning, we go to NSFW!
Seriously, Arenado had his chance
Have you watched any of this game
BEST DEFENSIVE SHORTSTOP TODAY, FIGHT ME
Yet you guys won the World Series?
He does the random delayed windup, yes
What are your other businesses?
sigh Kershaw can't pitch on short rest
Did we watch the same postseason
Coach's Corner is one of the best
God bless you Canada for Don cherry
i don't recall such an incident
Golf Knickerscom?No  No no noNo
This guy is the fuckin meme king
Does the no-htter bot work for the WBC?
Whoa  Shots Fired Have an upvote
Dude, he's like their 7th starter
Thomas got weird over the years, eh?
Thomas the Dank Engine is back!
Commercial Breaks have never been so fun
THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE MASHUPS!
They need to play the game the RIGHT way
Is it a Mizuno or a Wilson glove?
Lol it's alright Check his flair
There has indeed been an Arenado
I will get my butt on your tattoo
Giancarlo, unleash a ICBM to the moon
STANTON THIS ISN'T LITTLE LEAGUE BUD
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT STANTON?
The only answer is Colby Rasmus
Just put Posey in at DH already
At least his offense isn't bad though
Why the fuck did he swing at that?
His head, as opposed to his shoulder
I could imagine Josh Reddick there
Rock the camo and plaid  You'll be fine
More like Big E Small the Dank Engine
Stanton is  a more expensive arenado
Yes I alwaystry to have a cap on my head
; exhibition gameThere's your answer
Moving from TV to the fun stream
PR Fans: Puerto Rico-US Fans: USA!
I'll take one of those as a 6th starter!
I bet Yelich's brother is hawt!
Yes MLBN has the English broadcast
Nah, he managed to fuck up a sac bunt
Buster wouldn't have swung at that
Is your Reddit only in Spanish too?
Ah yes, the predictions business
Can someone summarize that story?
Dude is a corporal, I feel bad for him
At least he won't strike out up there
This ump is so inconsistent fucking hell
for about six innings now, yeah
wow, Berrios came in with a plan
The movement on that pitch was crazy
Haha yeah, I hear like 3 from where I am
That last pitch was unfair Do over
That was an exquisite pitching display
Hahahahaha I love this fucking video
hits 500' donger snaps bat id like it
Let's settle this Soup or Salad?
How the hell is that a fun fact?
Not much Puerto Rican culture in Japan
Too late I penciled you in for Tuesday
Minnesota please don't fuck him up
that stopwatch meme the disapointment
Top notch mid-inning entertainment
ah, the rickroll came early tonight
or Stroman through 9 because of reasons
IT'S NOT A RICK ROLL IF I ENJOY IT!!
At least it didn't happen in the 9th
Nothing like a nice Rick Rolled
It was only a matter of time tbh
Jokes on you, I actually like this song
Buster Posey once murdered Cincinnati
DID THIS MOTHERFUCKER JUST RICK ROLL US
how about Super saladI'll see myself out
Depends on what type of soup is offered
Why is Vasgersian talking about it?
Matty V going into full jinx mode
So many ground balls I fucking love it
; Dodger ~~Dog~~s are overrated
I was about to ask, really Mookie at 2?
USA Baseball It's got Electrolytes
This green line shit is dumb as hell
What did Stroman say to the PR bench?
The main one over in the mlb streams sub
you're gonna bunt to break it up?
God damn, a Mike Fetters reference
Mets fans Vegas or Bench for TJ?
top result on the  r mlbstreams thread
7 more pitches and Stroman is out
Yeah just keep talking about it, Matt
Why do they keep bringing it up
STOP SAYING THAT OR I WON'T BUY THE SHOW
Matt is definitely rooting for the PR
Get that old fuck off my screen
Stroman is absolutely untouchable
Utility guy for the New York Mets

The Astros will win the World Series
2nd rule: no outside food or drinks

True that Not in is last start though
That looked like it feltunpleasant
Because it was totally intentional
That's what I say every morning
Not my Lord Mine is from Asgard

Carry that into the season, Stro!
Aww Stro You had a great showing
At least Stroman gets an ovation
Wowthey actually care, this is great!
I DON'T WANT PAGAN RETURNING TO MLB

I think you answered your own question
Brandon Crawford was a hero today
Nah fam it's gotta be Pat Neshek
These announcers are freaking hilarious!
IsTHIS your guy?No JohnIsTHIS your guy?
Spoiler Alert: They lose to Team USA
Baseball cards do not actually talk
My vote is Crawford, my guess is Jones
after he ruined Stro's no-hitter?
Guy Fieri Puerto Rican confirmed
I mean, it worked out for the USA
So Hosmer is gonna win tourney MVP?
The catch and the timely hits and RBIs

Fucking Hosmer STOP MAKING ME LIKE YOU
GOOOOOD ANOTHER HIT FOR THE HIT GOD
ARENADO IS THE RALLY-STARTING GOD
They get enough hits they mercy rule'em
we can't even throw to first anymore
8-0 GOTTA GET THEM INSURANCE RUNS
Another chance to get a knockout
I'm getting tired of all this winning!
PR has twice the population of Hawaii
This is kind of brutal for puerto rico
Baez should have tried tagging him
Cutch flying down the line like he's 25
I still think you're awesome, Baez
T  R  A  I  N  W  R  E  C  KRAINWRECK
Dang PR is determined to go down hard
What is this history of Japan thing?
He just said a hot dog is NOT a sandwich
People were putting Rs and shit!
That aerial view was pretty cool
No mercy rule in the championship game
Javy giveth and Javy throws it away
well the more runs the better, but why?
No mercy rule in the championship
If Crawford can two more RBIs here
I think it's US Army regulation
u iDrinan, look it's your fake boy
Me too in my totally academic opinion
Fuck, I have a 8 AM class tomorrow
spring breaks down here were last week
Lo siento sobre su equipo, mi amigo
; YouTubeWell there's your problem
Did you say Hey Blinkin or Abe Lincoln?
Didn't that result in war last time?
ToniiiIIIIiiIIIight we are young
That's a mercy rule It doesn't apply
And a one-hitter for one of the sides
It's time for World War II!the sequel
Yeah, but keep them away from  u alstor
Anybody want to share some Japan Facts?
Isnt like baseball ultra popular in USA?
That's the best part of sportsball
No mercy in the championship round
No mercy in the championship game
No mercy rules in non-pool play
hahahahahahaha perfect ending point
Why come you don't have a tattoo?
Nah, mercy rule is not in effect
Can we bring in post-Pujols Lidge?
John Smoltz as Alexander Hamilton
~~Hiroshima~~~~Nagasaki~~Some Others
Understatement of the fucking century
It is technically a one possession game
I'd dress up as Jesus at a baseball game
Poor attempt at sarcasm,  sorry
No championship in mercy rounds
This pitchers delivery is whacky
He also would have thrown Sid Bream out
not a great answer there, Smoltz
Smoltz is a space master confirmed
John going as Christopher Columbus?
It's between Yelich and Jones for me
And also an admirable human being
Dude just google history of japan
John Smoltz is a communist confirmed
Christopher Columbus wasnt even American
He head-butted the Chinese flag at 1:41
I'd be cool with at least one run
I agree with Hoz a close second
theres literally like 30 seconds left
Something something Manifest Destiny
At least Yadier is still smiling
And it would still only be tied
PR is the Argentina of Baseball
AAAAANNNNDDDDD IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY!
Well didn't he step into Puerto Rico?
IT TAKES TWO TO MAKE A THING GO RIGHT
As in Los Angeles Dodgersright  s
This game is not going Puerto Rico's way
Kinsler makes it look so easy :)
I wanted it for Atlanta so bad :(
He lost a bunch of weight after 2014

Gregerson or Miller in the 9th?
Holy shit Rosario worked a walk!
Columbus was Italian  He was Genovese
Whatever helps up keep this lead man
Ok, can we get back to baseball?
Says the guy with Benedict Arnold flair
And then he got drunk and beat his wife
So is Clippard gonna close this out?
Let the bench guys Pinch hit Leyland?
WE HAVE A SAYING IN BROOKLYNHEY!

And rooting against the players lol
Ground out, fly out, ground out
Amazing performance by USA Just amazing!
The roasts were months ago dude
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
This is now a BILL WURTZ stream
He couldn't beat the Yankees though
that name triggers blackhawks fans
Matty V is so out of it at this point
that was the best ABCs I've ever heard
Lack of a long grinding season probably
Because they are on the right sleeve
My prediction is K-K-uh Strikeout
Wanna shake on it and be friends?
That was the win music yesterday
I wouldn't say he's theirproperty
Pls no watching with younger siblings
This is giving me some tomato anxiety
Makes me wonder where his wife was from
Who put Nelson Cruz out in right?
NELSON CRUZ, IS THAT YOU IN RF?

Wow, Matty V looks like Jimmy Kimmel
Adam Captain America Jones is my MVP
Gotta give the MVP to Adam Jones!

Honestly, it really looks like it!
Why not Marcus Goatman for mvp?
Just some random bench piece apparently
Stroman took a steaming dump on us
the mets are out my work is done
Right now I'd say the MVP is Hoz
Not as fun when you get your ass kicked
Ironically, they aren't rich enough
Hey not everyone could hire a samurai
Jonesy is going to make me finish
How is jones the MVP with a 206 average?
Actually he struck out last inning lol

He got that Golden Sombrero at least
Burgers, Bald Eagles, Freedom, oh yeah

You can have him for 48 more hours
You gotta account for the Coors effect
That'd be quite interesting haha
Hey man at least you still have Murph
It was a very heartwarming moment!
TEAM USA HAD TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION
Fair enough Do you have a source?

YouTube video called history of Japan
Kinda wanna get this tattooed on me

Be fair, in catcher years that's like 90
This ain't the NFL, don't be silly
The WC final that England won 4-2?
You have my upvote as a Canadian!
Something something Super Bowl 49
Congratulations USA！from JAPAN
